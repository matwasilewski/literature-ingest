Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy.

Although\nsystemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success,\ngenerally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide mar-\ngins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of\nclear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or over-\ntreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the\nuse of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV\nzoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and\navoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after\ndiagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as\ndocumented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal\nmobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature\nreview identiﬁed 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with\nPMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported\ncase of PMH and the ﬁrst successful and limb-sparing utilization of\nsystemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nKey Words: pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid\nsarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, limb preservation, sirolimus,\nzoledronic acid\n(J Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2019;00:000–000)\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is a rare\nneoplasm ﬁrst characterized by Mirra and colleagues in\n1992 in an analysis of 5 patients previously diagnosed with\nepithelioid sarcoma.1,2 PMH typically presents as slow-growing\nmultifocal nodules of one or more tissue planes of the extrem-\nities in young adults, with a strong male predominance.3,4 PMH\nhas morphologic and immunohistochemical features associated\nwith both vascular and sarcomatous tumors and has recently\nbeen associated with a novel t(7;9)(q22;q13) genotype producing\na SERPINE1-FOSB fusion protein.1–5Accepted initial treat-\nment is surgical or ablative.2,3,5 Local recurrence and spread is\ncommon with associated morbidity and rare mortality, but\nmetastasis to lungs and transformation to a more aggressive\nEwing Sarcoma-like neoplasm has been described.1–3,5 Risk of\nprogression and optimal management remain uncertain in this\nuncommon tumor.3,5,6\nThe uncertain prognosis and lack of well-studied alternative\ntherapies for PMH posed a clinical dilemma, such as in our\npatient, a 6-year-old boy who presented with multiostotic PMH\nof the bones of the right leg with growth plate involvement.\nPrevious case reports have included use of conventional chemo-\ntherapy agents, such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, and vincristine, but\nwith variable efﬁcacy (Table 1). Research has identiﬁed mTOR\ninhibition as a promising target in many sarcomas, including\nother perivascular hemangioendotheliomas,18 and use of an\nmTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitor (everolimus)\nhas been reported in one PMH case.16 Zoledronic acid (ZA),\nwhich inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, has demon-\nstrated effectiveness in preclinical models of bone sarcoma and is\nused as adjunctive therapy for metastasis prevention in other\ncancers.19–21 We report on the effective use of another mTOR\ninhibitor, sirolimus (SIR) together with ZA in our patient with\npotentially limb-sparing implications. We also performed a lit-\nerature review to identify and discuss previous reports of systemic\ntherapy in this rare disease.\nCASE REPORT\nA 6-year-old boy presented to his pediatrician with right ankle\npain at football practice and difﬁculty keeping up with his peers. He\nwas initially diagnosed with an ankle sprain and treated with rest,\nice, and ibuprofen. However, his pain worsened over several weeks\nprompting plain ﬁlm imaging that revealed a lytic expansile bone\nlesion of the distal ﬁbular metaphysis along with patchy sclerosis of\nmultiple bones of the foot and proximal and distal tibial and ﬁbular\nmetaphyses (Fig. 1). Our patient was referred to orthopedics, and\nbiopsy was performed which was read as “infection versus PMH”;\nsecond opinions, at our institution and elsewhere, however reached\na consensus of multifocal multiosteotic PMH of the leg. Pathology\nshowed “inﬁltrative clusters of large round to elongated cells with\nabundant homogenously staining dense eosinophilic cytoplasm\nsuggestive of muscle differentiation with characteristic FLI-1,\nCD31, and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 staining. Nuclei were enlarged\nwith irregular nuclear contours and coarse chromatin. “Vascular\nchannel formation”and “intracytoplasmic lumina”were not seen.\nUnfortunately, pathology slides from this outside study could not be\nobtained. Repeat biopsy done several month into treatment dem-\nonstrated sparse tumor cells with surrounding inﬂammatory inﬁl-\ntrate and loss of AE1/AE3 staining (Fig. 2). This was felt to be\nconsistent with an initial response to treatment in the setting of an\ninfectious/inﬂammatory complication as discussed below.

Sentinel lymph node\nbiopsy was negative for disease. Overall interval between pre-\nsentation of symptoms and conclusive diagnosis was 4 months.\nAmputation was recommended by several experts. After mul-\ntidisciplinary tumor board and outside expert consultations as well as\nfamily meetings, the family agreed to a recommended course of ZA\n(2.3 mg/m\n2\n/mo, max 4 mg/mo) and sirolimus (SIR, 3 mg/m\n2\n/d, target\ntrough 8 to 12 ng/mL) as initial therapy with the goal of avoiding\namputation. At the time of this writing the patient completed 27 ZA\ninfusions with concurrent SIR without dose modiﬁcation or deviation\nfrom goal SIR troughs.\nTreatment was associated with possible bone infection/ inﬂam-\nmation at 5 months that resolved and with mild and manageable bone\npain, occasional low grade fevers, and transient mucositis. Partial\nresponse was seen on PET-CT at 2 months, with near complete\nresponse at 13 months. Subsequent imaging has demonstrated reso-\nlution of the infectious/inﬂammatory process and sustained remission\nfrom 13 months to the present (37 mo) (Figs. 3, 4).

Follow-up time was unspeciﬁed\nin 2 cases and otherwise ranged from 10 weeks to 19 years\n(median 18 mo). Common presenting symptoms included one\nor more nodules with or without pain, including several\npatients who were initially diagnosed with more common\ninfectious/inﬂammatory conditions or did not present until\nnodules multiplied or ulcerated prompting biopsy. Two cases\nwere initially treated with orthopedic surgery or casting and\ndiagnosed upon routine follow-up imaging or nodule\nappearance upon cast removal.1,8 There was no clear rela-\ntionship between prompt diagnosis and outcome; interval\nbetween development of symptoms and diagnosis of PMH,\nwhere reported, was highly variable. In one case, a patient\npresented after a year-long history of painful lower extremity\nskin lesions and required amputation of a toe but remained\ndisease-free at 2 years’follow-up afterwards.9Conversely, 2\ncases with terminal or metastatic outcomes saw a delay to\ndiagnosis of only 1 to 3 months.1,11 Lower extremity disease\nwas the initial lesion in 13 patients, compared with 4 with\nupper extremity lesions, 2 with primary truncal lesions, and a\nsingle case of perioral soft tissue nodules.\nOf these 20 patients, 7 received some form of systemic\ntherapy,1,2,9,14,16 only 2 of which did so as part of an initial/\nprimary treatment plan.1,16 These include a 22-year-old\nmale who received conventional chemotherapy and wide\nexcision without achieving disease control and subsequently\nwas treated with everolimus resulting in treatment response\nand unspeciﬁed disease status at 5 months.16 In 2 cases, the\nspeciﬁc chemotherapy agent was not speciﬁed.2,9\nAll but 3 patients (85%) were treated surgically at ﬁrst\npresentation; an 18-year-old male with upper extremity\ndisease who received classical chemotherapy before simple\nexcision eventually developed pulmonary metastases and\nrepresents the single conﬁrmed fatality in this review1—a\nsecond patient was noted to be alive with probable lung\nmetastases at 3 months.9A 30-year-old male patient refused\namputation and opted for metronomic oral cyclo-\nphosphamide and prednisone resulting in treatment failure\nand amputation at 10 months.13 Five amputations were\nperformed in total including one above the knee and one\nhemipelvectomy.1,9,10,13,14 Local radiofrequency ablation\n(RFA) and/or radiotherapy (RT) were used to supplement\nFIGURE 1.

To the best of our knowledge, our selected cases\nrepresent the largest single review of pediatric and of adoles-\ncent and young adult cases of PMH to date, with Hornick and\nFletcher’s 2011 review of 50 cases representing the largest age-\nunrestricted collection.3In keeping with other publications,\nwe saw a male predominance (65% vs. 35%) and a high\nfrequency of involvement of multiple tissue planes (bone,\nmuscle, subcutaneous and subdermal fat, and/or skin). A\nmajority (75%) of cases involved multiple sites at presentation,\nand 85% presented with disease in a single extremity, similar\nto our patient. We also believe that our patient is the youngest\nreported PMH. In addition our patients multiple primary\nwere conﬁned to bone (seen in only 10% of reviewed cases)\nwith only 3 such cases previously described.13 Our review\nfound that recurrences at the same site with uncommon local\nspread and rarely metastasis are reported.\nIn our literature review, we did not ﬁnd clear associations\nor hypotheses regarding speciﬁc environmental, metabolic,\nFIGURE 3.

In tissue biopsy studies\nby Trombetta et al,17 however, metaphase FISH demon-\nstrated a balanced t(7;19)(q22;q13) translocation in all sam-\nples tested, and an unbalanced der(7)t(7;19)(q22;q13) t(7;19)\nin 1 of 9 samples tested. This translocation has since been\nfound to code for a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion protein.5This\ngene product results in abnormal constitutive expression of\nFOSB, which contributes to the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1)\ntranscription factor complex known to be involved in a range\nof cell growth and differentiation processes.5,22,23 In at least 2\ncases of PMH, this translocation was the only identiﬁed\ncytogenetic abnormality and is therefore a likely candidate for\nthe initiating event in the natural history of this disease.5,17 In\nthe years following its initial discovery, this translocation has\nbeen frequently described as a characteristic feature of\nPMH.22,24,25 However, direct conﬁrmation of its presence is\nrare in our review of cases involving young patients, with only\none recent (post-2011) case report including this data. Other\ngenetic ﬁndings reported in PMH include Tuberous Sclerosis\n1 (TSC1) mutation in one tumor, which was the basis for\nselection of the mTOR-inhibitor drug, everolimus as systemic\ntherapy in that patient.18 Ourowneffortstoperformnext\ngeneration testing, after 2 failed attempts showed a FOSB-\nACTB gene fusion thought to be supportive of the histologic\ndiagnosis of PMH (personal communication with Denis\nAdams, Harvard).\nUSE OF SIROLIMUS: No systemic therapies are\nFDA approved for treatment of PMH. However, sirolimus\nis one of the ﬁrst systematic agents to show efﬁcacy in the\ntreatment of complex vascular malformations. SIR inhibits\nmTOR by allosteric interaction with the FK506 binding\nprotein, although its full mechanism(s) of action are felt to\nbe incompletely understood. The mTOR pathway is\ninvolved in regulation of a wide range of crucial cell func-\ntions, including angiogenesis, cell division, cell motility, and\nprotein synthesis, and responds to a wide range of inputs,\nnotably tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGFr and the\nPI3k/AKT axis.26,27 As such, SIR and its analogues have\nbeen the subject of considerable interest in the treatment of\nneoplastic disease. In some studies constituent endothelial\ncell overexpression of targets of mTOR, such as cKit, have\nbeen identiﬁed.28 The exact role of these differences in gene\nexpression in the pathogenesis, progression, and response to\ntreatment with mTOR inhibition has not been elucidated.\nSirolimus has been a successful systemic agent in the\ntreatment of rare complex vascular malformations, including\nKaposiform hemangioendothelioma, which shares some fea-\ntures with PMH, forming the basis for our outside consultation\nand the recommend use and tolerability of SIR.26,28–30\nUse of Zoledronic Acid\nAs a bisphosphonate, Zoledronic acid has been found\nto have many beneﬁts in bone disease and thus given the\nunusually bony involvement for our patient and the very\nreal possibility of pathologic fracture and need for ampu-\ntation it was thought that ZA was reasonable to add to SIR.\nZoledronic acid inhibits osteoclast activity through com-\npetitive binding to hydroxyapatite crystal in sites of actively\nremodeling bone, preventing normal pyrophosphate-mediated\nresorption. ZA also contributes to osteoclast apoptosis by\ninhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase.21 Its hypothe-\nsized utility in cancer includes both mitigation of skeletal\ninstability because of metastases and disruption of the osteo-\nclast-supported microenvironment that favors tumor cell sur-\nvival, growth, and proliferation within primary and metastatic\nbony lesions. Recently, additional direct antitumor effects have\nbeen suggested21,31 although this remains poorly characterized.\nA study of bisphosphonate use in low-risk breast cancer\nshowed reduced incidence of bony metastases and overall\nmortality at 6-year follow-up21 and ZA has also shown efﬁcacy\nin reducing morbidity and rate of disease progression in\nmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and multiple\nmyeloma.31,32 Its utility in bony sarcomas has been promising\nin preclinical models31 and is well-tolerated in both adult and\npediatric populations.32,33 ZA is the subject of an ongoing\nphase II clinical trial in Ewing Sarcoma.34 However, no beneﬁt\nwas seen to adding ZA to standard chemotherapy in a\nrandomized phase III trial in osteosarcoma.35 In our patient\nwith PMH of bone who responded to therapy with ZA and\nSIR, it is not possible to determine the extent to which ZA\ncontributed to tumor response. However, it is possible to\nhypothesize that ZA contributed to protection against skel-\netal-related events (SRE), such as pathologic fracture in our\nefforts to avoid or delay ablative surgery.\nLimb Sparing in PMH\nLimb-sparing therapies attempted in previous cases have\nincluded surgery, radiation, and radiofrequency ablation\n(RFA) with their attendant morbidities, such as limb insta-\nbility, permanent tissue damage, risk of sarcoma induction\nand dysfunction in an active child. To our knowledge, this is\nﬁrst reported case of attempted limb sparing with systemic\ntherapy, where the other choices were felt to have too great a\nmorbidity by the family and the treating team.\nStudy Limitations\nAs with previous reviews, our review of children and\nyoung adults did not uncover any speciﬁc indicator(s) of\nmetastatic potential or any high-risk subpopulation. The\neffect of ZA and SIR on the patient’s long-term risk of\nmetastasis, recurrence, and progression, are not known nor\nare the long-term side effects. Potential long-term compli-\ncations/late effects of ZA and sirolimus potentially include\nosteonecrosis, renal impairment, reduced fertility, hyper-\ntriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.36–38\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe successful use of systemic therapy as primary\ntreatment for PMH is an important development both for\npatients who are ineligible for or refuse more aggressive\ntherapy and for patients who may receive greater beneﬁt\nwith combined systemic and local therapies than they would\nfrom standard wide excision alone. It is hoped systemic\ntherapy may mitigate risk of metastasis and, local recur-\nrence which exceeded metastasis as a consequence of failure\nof disease control. This report must be interpreted cau-\ntiously, as data on this disease remains limited and pre-\nviously reported outcomes of systemic therapy demonstrate\nmarked variation.

Three case reports of pediatric PHE showed that everolimus and sirolimus were effective as the first-line or later-line treatment.

Cóccaro\nPablo Roitman\nLucas R Brun\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) can be a challenge for diagnosis and might be confused with other tumors, such as epithelioid sarcoma. Here we present a case and a systematic review of the literature to identify and discuss PMH treatment in primary bone involvement. A 25-year-old woman was referred for bone pain (10/10) in the left lower limb. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple bone lesions (left femur, tibia, patella, ankle, and foot) with well-defined borders without signs of local aggressiveness. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) showed multiple metabolic musculoskeletal lesions in the left lower limb. A CT scan-guided biopsy was performed. Histological and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of PMH. After treatment with intravenous pamidronate (90 mg/monthly), the patient had clinical improvement, mild pain 2/10 without the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opiates. Follow-up was assessed by MRI and PET-CT. PET-CT showed metabolic resolution of most of the bone and muscular lesions and a significant improvement of the femoral lesion. MRI showed that the lesions in the left femur, tibia, and foot had a marked decrease in size without intravenous post-contrast enhancement and smaller lesions had disappeared. After a 3-year follow-up, PET-CT showed no metabolically active images. Literature review identified 31 records including 58 clinical cases of PMH with primary bone involvement and treatment description for qualitative analysis. Most lesions (69%) were treated by local excision or curettage. In addition, amputations were performed in a significant percentage of cases (20.7%). In the last years, mTOR inhibitors (n = 7) and anti-resorptive treatments (n = 4) were considered as alternative treatment options, especially in multifocal lesions.\nView\nShow abstract\n... 12 In contrast, several targeted drugs, such as sirolimus, everolimus, and telatinib, have shown efficacy with fewer side effects than chemotherapy. [12][13][14][15][16] Unfortunately, the low incidence of PHE does not allow investigators to perform systematic clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of a specific treatment, and long-term follow-up data for a specific treatment are limited. Therefore, no systemic therapies have been officially approved for the management of PHE. ...\n... 18 mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus and everolimus, have been effectively used for targeted therapy of PHE.

In our study, we clearly correlated the effectiveness of sirolimus therapy with a PHErelated genetic aberration, that is, a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion resulting in overexpression of intact FOSB. ...\nA novel SERPINE1‐FOSB fusion gene in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma results in activation of intact FOSB and the PI3K‐AKT‐mTOR signaling pathway and responsiveness to sirolimus\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nSep 2021\n\n\nJun Ren\n\nXiaohui Wang\nYulin Zhou\nQiwei Guo\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is an extremely rare disease that affects mainly the young and more men than women. PHE are multicentric, locally aggressive, have low metastatic potential, and affect multiple tissue planes. Genetic aberrations are frequently detected in PHE and may play important roles in the occurrence, development, and treatment of this disease. In this study, we report a case of PHE with a novel SERPINE1‐FOSB fusion gene. The fusion introduced a strong promoter near the coding region of FOSB, resulting in overexpression of intact FOSB. Immunohistochemical analysis showed overexpression of pAKT and mTOR in tumor cells, suggesting activation of the PI3K‐AKT‐mTOR signaling pathway. The patient responded well to targeted therapy with sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. Our study correlated dysregulation of a specific signaling pathway and the effectiveness of a targeted therapy to a specific genetic aberration. This information may be useful for future investigations of targeted therapeutics and provide a potential predictive biomarker for therapeutic effectiveness in PHE cases.\nView\nShow abstract\nBeyond the rare: a case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma treated sequentially with everolimus, denosumab, and pazopanib\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nNov 2024\n\n\nDouglas Dias e Silva\n\nCamila Bobato Lara Gismondi\nMurilo Marques Almeida Silva\nRoberto Carmagnani Pestana\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is an ultra-rare vascular sarcoma that most commonly affects young adults, with a male predominance. It is diagnosed using a combination of imaging studies, histopathological examinations, and immunohistochemical staining. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, with the goal of achieving a wide local excision and reducing the risk of recurrence. The role of systemic therapies is not well established because of the rarity of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, uncertainty regarding its response to currently approved medications, and lack of randomized controlled trials. We describe the case of an 18-year-old male patient diagnosed with multifocal pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma of the left lower limb who was treated with everolimus in addition to denosumab, achieving a partial response that was consolidated with resection, radiofrequency ablation, and radiotherapy of multiple local lesions, achieving a long-lasting response. Following subsequent disease progression, the patient responded favorably to pazopanib, with no significant toxicities.\nView\nShow abstract\nPseudomyogenes Hämangioendotheliom der äußeren Genitalien: Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the external genitalia\nArticle\n\n\nMay 2024\n\n\nJiong Zhou\n\nDian‐He Yu\nXin‐Rong Chen\nSui-Qing Cai\n\nView\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the external genitalia\nArticle\n\n\nApr 2024\n\n\nJiong Zhou\n\nDian‐He Yu\nXin‐Rong Chen\nSui-Qing Cai\n\nView\nPrimary vascular tumors of bone: A comprehensive literature review on classification, diagnosis and treatment\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJan 2024\n\n\nIlaria Tortorelli\n\nElena Bellan\nBenedetta Chiusole\nAntonella Brunello\n\nView\nA case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma misdiagnosed as low-grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma and review of literature\nArticle\n\nMar 2022\n\nJ Cent S Univ Med Sci\n\n\nJundong Huang\n\nWei Shi\nJi Li\nYongbin Hu\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a rare angiogenic tumor. Histologically, the morphological characteristics of neoplastic vessels and endothelial differentiation are not obvious, and it is easy to be confused with epithelioid sarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and myogenic tumor. PHE usually occurs in arms and legs in young people and has a significant male predominance. The tumor has a predilection for the distal extremities and its typical manifestation is multiple center invasion of a single limb, which can involve all layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues,and is often accompanied by abvious pain. Histologically, PHE is characterized by infiltrative growth of tumor. Most tumor lesions are composed of sheets and loose fascicles of plump spindle or epithelioid cells within a background of variably prominent inflammatory infiltration, which was commonly composed of neutrophils. Some cells may resemble rhabdomyoblasts, and nuclear atypia and mitosis were rare. The tumor cells generally expressed positive cytokeratin (CK), ETS-related gene (ERG), Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) and integrase interactor 1(INI1). In some cases, the tumor cells expressed CD31. A case of a young woman was reported in this paper, who presented with a subcutaneous mass with severe pain and was chronologically misdiagnosed with herpes zoster, low-grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. In this study, the clinical and pathological features, differential diagnosis and the latest progress in therapy of PHE were analyzed based on relevant literature.\nView\nShow abstract\nSystematic review of sirolimus in dermatological conditions\nArticle\n\n\nJul 2021\n\n\nAndrew W Swarbrick\n\nAaron J Frederiks\nRachael S Foster\n\nSirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORI) with anti‐proliferative, antiangiogenic and immunosuppressive properties. While approved in Australia as an anti‐rejection medication for renal transplant patients, there is mounting evidence regarding the utility of oral and topical sirolimus in treating a plethora of dermatological conditions or conditions with cutaneous manifestations. Our aim was to present an overview of the evidence for current usage and breadth of the application of sirolimus in dermatology. We carried out a systematic review of all the literature published up to 31 August 2019 on oral and topical sirolimus with respect to dermatological conditions or conditions otherwise relevant to dermatology. While 3368 papers were initially produced in our search, 238 papers met our inclusion criteria and were examined in our review. The conditions examined were categorised into genodermatoses (9 conditions), infection (1 condition), inflammatory/autoimmune (10 conditions), neoplasm (3 conditions) and vascular (17 conditions). We extracted data on first author, publication year, journal, characteristics of the study and study patients, condition, drug modalities, drug efficacy, side effects, blood level of mTORI, co‐interventions and follow‐up. While there is level 1 evidence for the efficacy of sirolimus in conditions such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and GVHD prophylaxis, for many other conditions, the evidence is limited to level 4 evidence. Regarding oral systemic therapy, dosing regimens varied with the most common for children 0.8mg/m2 twice daily and for adults 1 mg twice daily. Doses were often adjusted to reach a typical trough level of between 5 and 15 ng/mL, though targets often varied. In the overall majority of cases, side effects were minimal or tolerable, including mucositis, cytopenias, lipid abnormalities and nausea/vomiting, and only a few cases had to stop due to adverse effects.

Extensive cases are treated with amputation as chemotherapy seems to be ineffective. Recently, promising results were published using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tumors of vascular origin. Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity. This case contributes to the growing evidence regarding the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, in multifocal PMH.\nKeywords: mTOR inhibition; pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; sirolimus.\n© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nEverolimus for Treatment of Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma.\nOzeki M, Nozawa A, Kanda K, Hori T, Nagano A, Shimada A, Miyazaki T, Fukao T.

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported case of PMH and the first successful and limb-sparing utilization of systemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nNo Reference information available - sign in for access.\nNo Citation information available - sign in for access.\nNo Supplementary Data.\nNo Article Media\nNo Metrics\nKeywords: epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma; limb preservation; pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; sirolimus; zoledronic acid\nDocument Type: Research Article\nAffiliations: 1: Family Medicine Residency Program, Samaritan Health Services, Corvalis, OR 2: Rush University Medical Center 3: Morrissey College of Arts and Science, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA 4: Departments of Pathology 5: Radiology 6: Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine 7: Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL\nPublication date: July 1, 2019\nClose Signup Dialog\nSign-in\nRegister\n\nUsername: \nPassword:  \n\n\nRemember Login\nLogin reminder\nOpenAthens\nShibboleth\nTools\n\n\n\nActivate personal subscription\n\n\n\nReference exports +-\n\nEndNote\nBibTEX\n\n\n\nLinking options +-\n\nIngenta Connect\nOpenURL\nIngenta DOI\nDOI\n\n\n\n\n Receive new issue alert\nLatest TOC RSS Feed\nRecent Issues RSS Feed\n\n\n\n© Get Permissions\n\nFavourites\nAccessibility\n\nShare Content\n\nAccess Key\nFree content\nPartial Free content\nNew content\nOpen access content\nPartial Open access content\nSubscribed content\nPartial Subscribed content\n\nFree trial content\n\n\nBrowse by Publication\n\nBrowse by Subject\nBrowse by Publisher\n\nAdvanced Search\n\n\nAbout us\n\nResearchers\n\nLibrarians\n\n\nNew featured titles\n\nHelp\n\nContact us\n\n\nYoutube\n\ntwitter\n\nlinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWebsite © 2025 Ingenta.

This tumor is rare; therefore, detailed information regarding this tumor is still lacking.\nHere, we report a case of a man in his 20s presenting with left foot pain for about one year. Imaging showed a 2-cm ovoid, cortically based lesion with a lytic defect of the cortex at the fifth metatarsal proximal shaft. Histologically, the lesion presented as an infiltrating proliferation of distinctly myoid-appearing spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and mildly atypical vesicular nuclei. Scant mitoses were identified with no areas of necrosis. Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin expression as well as CD31 and ERG. CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells, and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present.\nOver half of the patients with PMH develop multifocal lesions, often involving several tissue planes; however, distant metastasis is very infrequent. This patient underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the prognosis of these lesions.\nKeywords: solitary lesion, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, indolent, vascular, sarcoma, epithelioid, hemangioendothelioma\nIntroduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is an endothelial neoplasm, mostly indolent and with low-grade malignancy, having several different classifications. The current nomenclature was originally described by Hornick and Fletcher (2011), in which its myoid and epithelioid-like histologic pattern is defined as \"pseudomyogenic\" [1]. It is predominantly found in young adult males, at approximately 30 years of age, and in the distal extremities [1]. This vascular neoplasm is multifocal and can involve the dermis, subcutis, and bone [2]. The multifocality of these tumors tends to involve the same local anatomical regions as the original tumor [3]. This tumor is rare; therefore, investigation for additional detailed information regarding this tumor is warranted.\nCase presentation\nA male in his 20s presented with increasing pain in his left foot for the past year. He had a history of hypertension but had no other medical problems or trauma. A physical exam revealed tenderness over the fifth metatarsal, particularly at the proximal shaft. There was no warmth, erythema, or lymphadenopathy, and a reassuring distal neurovascular exam. Plain X-rays revealed a 2-cm ovoid lytic lesion in the fifth metatarsal, with a saucer-like deformity and significant scalloping, favoring reparative granuloma, chondroma, periosteal desmoid, or other neoplasms (Figure 1). The lesion was also identified on CT and MRI. A biopsy of the lesion was taken at the time of surgery.\nFigure 1.

Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin AE1&3 expression, as well as CD31 and ERG (Figure 3). CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells (Figure 3), and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present.\nFigure 3.

(D) Diffusely positive ERG stain (400x magnification).\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) panel with 58 gene fusions (Cleveland Clinic Foundation panel) was performed and no gene fusion was detected. These findings are consistent with an epithelioid sarcoma-like epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), with a differential diagnosis including epithelioid vascular neoplasm and epithelioid sarcoma. The retention of INI1 expression, strong CD31 positivity, and lack of diffuse CD34 argue against epithelioid sarcoma, which was described as PMH.\nThe decision was made to treat the lesion with debridement, curettage, grafting, and internal fixation. Post-surgical follow-up positron emission tomography (PET) scans were negative, and CT scans have shown progressive healing of the pathologic fracture and the cavitating cortical lesion (Figure 4). There was no evidence of recurrent tumor, including local recurrence or local spread to other sites after seven years of follow-up.\nFigure 4.

(A) Anterolateral view; (B) anterior view.\nDiscussion\nPMH is a rare tumor, mainly occurring in males with an average age of 31 years [1]. PMH can be asymptomatic, but the most common symptom is pain in the region of the tumor [4]. It most commonly occurs in the dermis and subcutis tissue layer, yet approximately half of the cases have intramuscular lesions, and 20% are intraosseous [1]. Grossly, 70% of these lesions are multifocal, unlike in this case as a solitary lesion, and average in size between 1 and 2.5 cm [2,5]. It is a mostly indolent tumor with a low likelihood to metastasize, as also demonstrated in this case [1]. The main treatment for PMH is debridement; however, chemotherapy is also used. Targeted angiogenic drugs have been proposed, specifically as a treatment for vascular tumors. Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitor drug in which mTOR is prevented from activating protein synthesis and angiogenesis. Sirolimus (rapamycin) and derivatives have been predicted to be an effective and less toxic treatment compared to chemotherapy for PMH [2].\nHistologic morphology of PMH consists of neoplastic cells that are enlarged, spindled, and with bright eosinophilic cytoplasm that can mimic rhabdomyoblasts. They contain mild nuclear atypia and infrequent mitotic activity [1,6].\nPMH has an inclusive differential diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteoblastoma, and vascular tumors [4]. PMH has presenting similarities with epithelioid sarcomas, such as presenting in the skin and soft tissue in the distal extremities and having diffuse keratin positivity [1]. This case represents the importance of identifying and distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors with poorer prognoses. To differentiate between PMH and epithelioid sarcoma, as both have cytokeratin positivity, epithelioid sarcoma expresses MNF116 and AE1&3 and has a loss of expression of INI1 (90%) and CD34 (50%) [3,7]. PMH is also negative for pan-cytokeratin, EMA, and CD34, in which 50% are positive in epithelioid sarcoma [1,3,7]. Histologically, PMH can mimic other skeletal muscle tumors; however, PMH lacks expression for actin, MyoD1, and desmin [1,6,8]. PMH usually shows reactivity with vascular markers, including CD31, FLI1, and ERG, as well as co-expresses vimentin and keratins such as AE1&3, CK7, and CAM5.2 [6].\nAnother useful tool in the diagnosis of PMH is the use of FOSB immunohistochemistry. The FOSB expression for PMH is strongly positive [9]. The SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusion due to the chromosomal translocation t(7;19)(q22;q13) has been identified in several cases [6,10]. The WHO 2020 classification reported on recently identified genetic alterations in which PMH has SERPINE1-FOSB and ACTB-FOSB, which can be useful when distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors [10]. The differential diagnosis for PMH can be broad, and the rarity emphasizes the importance of immunohistochemical stains and increases the possibility of being overlooked.\nConclusions\nPMH is a rare neoplasm, particularly with the involvement of the bone. It is characterized as a multifocal, male-predominant tumor with predominantly spindled epithelioid morphology and positive keratin markers. We presented a patient who underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the importance of the identification of these lesions and their effects on treatment and prognosis.\nThe content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

Although\nsystemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success,\ngenerally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide mar-\ngins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of\nclear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or over-\ntreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the\nuse of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV\nzoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and\navoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after\ndiagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as\ndocumented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal\nmobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature\nreview identiﬁed 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with\nPMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported\ncase of PMH and the ﬁrst successful and limb-sparing utilization of\nsystemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nKey Words: pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid\nsarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, limb preservation, sirolimus,\nzoledronic acid\n(J Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2019;00:000–000)\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is a rare\nneoplasm ﬁrst characterized by Mirra and colleagues in\n1992 in an analysis of 5 patients previously diagnosed with\nepithelioid sarcoma.1,2 PMH typically presents as slow-growing\nmultifocal nodules of one or more tissue planes of the extrem-\nities in young adults, with a strong male predominance.3,4 PMH\nhas morphologic and immunohistochemical features associated\nwith both vascular and sarcomatous tumors and has recently\nbeen associated with a novel t(7;9)(q22;q13) genotype producing\na SERPINE1-FOSB fusion protein.1–5Accepted initial treat-\nment is surgical or ablative.2,3,5 Local recurrence and spread is\ncommon with associated morbidity and rare mortality, but\nmetastasis to lungs and transformation to a more aggressive\nEwing Sarcoma-like neoplasm has been described.1–3,5 Risk of\nprogression and optimal management remain uncertain in this\nuncommon tumor.3,5,6\nThe uncertain prognosis and lack of well-studied alternative\ntherapies for PMH posed a clinical dilemma, such as in our\npatient, a 6-year-old boy who presented with multiostotic PMH\nof the bones of the right leg with growth plate involvement.\nPrevious case reports have included use of conventional chemo-\ntherapy agents, such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, and vincristine, but\nwith variable efﬁcacy (Table 1). Research has identiﬁed mTOR\ninhibition as a promising target in many sarcomas, including\nother perivascular hemangioendotheliomas,18 and use of an\nmTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitor (everolimus)\nhas been reported in one PMH case.16 Zoledronic acid (ZA),\nwhich inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, has demon-\nstrated effectiveness in preclinical models of bone sarcoma and is\nused as adjunctive therapy for metastasis prevention in other\ncancers.19–21 We report on the effective use of another mTOR\ninhibitor, sirolimus (SIR) together with ZA in our patient with\npotentially limb-sparing implications. We also performed a lit-\nerature review to identify and discuss previous reports of systemic\ntherapy in this rare disease.\nCASE REPORT\nA 6-year-old boy presented to his pediatrician with right ankle\npain at football practice and difﬁculty keeping up with his peers. He\nwas initially diagnosed with an ankle sprain and treated with rest,\nice, and ibuprofen. However, his pain worsened over several weeks\nprompting plain ﬁlm imaging that revealed a lytic expansile bone\nlesion of the distal ﬁbular metaphysis along with patchy sclerosis of\nmultiple bones of the foot and proximal and distal tibial and ﬁbular\nmetaphyses (Fig. 1). Our patient was referred to orthopedics, and\nbiopsy was performed which was read as “infection versus PMH”;\nsecond opinions, at our institution and elsewhere, however reached\na consensus of multifocal multiosteotic PMH of the leg. Pathology\nshowed “inﬁltrative clusters of large round to elongated cells with\nabundant homogenously staining dense eosinophilic cytoplasm\nsuggestive of muscle differentiation with characteristic FLI-1,\nCD31, and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 staining. Nuclei were enlarged\nwith irregular nuclear contours and coarse chromatin. “Vascular\nchannel formation”and “intracytoplasmic lumina”were not seen.\nUnfortunately, pathology slides from this outside study could not be\nobtained. Repeat biopsy done several month into treatment dem-\nonstrated sparse tumor cells with surrounding inﬂammatory inﬁl-\ntrate and loss of AE1/AE3 staining (Fig. 2). This was felt to be\nconsistent with an initial response to treatment in the setting of an\ninfectious/inﬂammatory complication as discussed below. Next-\ngeneration sequencing of tumor biopsy samples to detect the (7;19)\n(q22;q13) FOSB/SERPINE1 [Finkel-Biskis-Jinkins murine osteo-\nsarcoma viral oncogene homolog B/Serpin Family E Member 1]\nfusion, thought to be characteristic failed twice.

Sentinel lymph node\nbiopsy was negative for disease. Overall interval between pre-\nsentation of symptoms and conclusive diagnosis was 4 months.\nAmputation was recommended by several experts. After mul-\ntidisciplinary tumor board and outside expert consultations as well as\nfamily meetings, the family agreed to a recommended course of ZA\n(2.3 mg/m\n2\n/mo, max 4 mg/mo) and sirolimus (SIR, 3 mg/m\n2\n/d, target\ntrough 8 to 12 ng/mL) as initial therapy with the goal of avoiding\namputation. At the time of this writing the patient completed 27 ZA\ninfusions with concurrent SIR without dose modiﬁcation or deviation\nfrom goal SIR troughs.\nTreatment was associated with possible bone infection/ inﬂam-\nmation at 5 months that resolved and with mild and manageable bone\npain, occasional low grade fevers, and transient mucositis. Partial\nresponse was seen on PET-CT at 2 months, with near complete\nresponse at 13 months. Subsequent imaging has demonstrated reso-\nlution of the infectious/inﬂammatory process and sustained remission\nfrom 13 months to the present (37 mo) (Figs. 3, 4).

Follow-up time was unspeciﬁed\nin 2 cases and otherwise ranged from 10 weeks to 19 years\n(median 18 mo). Common presenting symptoms included one\nor more nodules with or without pain, including several\npatients who were initially diagnosed with more common\ninfectious/inﬂammatory conditions or did not present until\nnodules multiplied or ulcerated prompting biopsy. Two cases\nwere initially treated with orthopedic surgery or casting and\ndiagnosed upon routine follow-up imaging or nodule\nappearance upon cast removal.1,8 There was no clear rela-\ntionship between prompt diagnosis and outcome; interval\nbetween development of symptoms and diagnosis of PMH,\nwhere reported, was highly variable. In one case, a patient\npresented after a year-long history of painful lower extremity\nskin lesions and required amputation of a toe but remained\ndisease-free at 2 years’follow-up afterwards.9Conversely, 2\ncases with terminal or metastatic outcomes saw a delay to\ndiagnosis of only 1 to 3 months.1,11 Lower extremity disease\nwas the initial lesion in 13 patients, compared with 4 with\nupper extremity lesions, 2 with primary truncal lesions, and a\nsingle case of perioral soft tissue nodules.\nOf these 20 patients, 7 received some form of systemic\ntherapy,1,2,9,14,16 only 2 of which did so as part of an initial/\nprimary treatment plan.1,16 These include a 22-year-old\nmale who received conventional chemotherapy and wide\nexcision without achieving disease control and subsequently\nwas treated with everolimus resulting in treatment response\nand unspeciﬁed disease status at 5 months.16 In 2 cases, the\nspeciﬁc chemotherapy agent was not speciﬁed.2,9\nAll but 3 patients (85%) were treated surgically at ﬁrst\npresentation; an 18-year-old male with upper extremity\ndisease who received classical chemotherapy before simple\nexcision eventually developed pulmonary metastases and\nrepresents the single conﬁrmed fatality in this review1—a\nsecond patient was noted to be alive with probable lung\nmetastases at 3 months.9A 30-year-old male patient refused\namputation and opted for metronomic oral cyclo-\nphosphamide and prednisone resulting in treatment failure\nand amputation at 10 months.13 Five amputations were\nperformed in total including one above the knee and one\nhemipelvectomy.1,9,10,13,14 Local radiofrequency ablation\n(RFA) and/or radiotherapy (RT) were used to supplement\nFIGURE 1.

To the best of our knowledge, our selected cases\nrepresent the largest single review of pediatric and of adoles-\ncent and young adult cases of PMH to date, with Hornick and\nFletcher’s 2011 review of 50 cases representing the largest age-\nunrestricted collection.3In keeping with other publications,\nwe saw a male predominance (65% vs. 35%) and a high\nfrequency of involvement of multiple tissue planes (bone,\nmuscle, subcutaneous and subdermal fat, and/or skin). A\nmajority (75%) of cases involved multiple sites at presentation,\nand 85% presented with disease in a single extremity, similar\nto our patient. We also believe that our patient is the youngest\nreported PMH. In addition our patients multiple primary\nwere conﬁned to bone (seen in only 10% of reviewed cases)\nwith only 3 such cases previously described.13 Our review\nfound that recurrences at the same site with uncommon local\nspread and rarely metastasis are reported.\nIn our literature review, we did not ﬁnd clear associations\nor hypotheses regarding speciﬁc environmental, metabolic,\nFIGURE 3.

In tissue biopsy studies\nby Trombetta et al,17 however, metaphase FISH demon-\nstrated a balanced t(7;19)(q22;q13) translocation in all sam-\nples tested, and an unbalanced der(7)t(7;19)(q22;q13) t(7;19)\nin 1 of 9 samples tested. This translocation has since been\nfound to code for a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion protein.5This\ngene product results in abnormal constitutive expression of\nFOSB, which contributes to the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1)\ntranscription factor complex known to be involved in a range\nof cell growth and differentiation processes.5,22,23 In at least 2\ncases of PMH, this translocation was the only identiﬁed\ncytogenetic abnormality and is therefore a likely candidate for\nthe initiating event in the natural history of this disease.5,17 In\nthe years following its initial discovery, this translocation has\nbeen frequently described as a characteristic feature of\nPMH.22,24,25 However, direct conﬁrmation of its presence is\nrare in our review of cases involving young patients, with only\none recent (post-2011) case report including this data. Other\ngenetic ﬁndings reported in PMH include Tuberous Sclerosis\n1 (TSC1) mutation in one tumor, which was the basis for\nselection of the mTOR-inhibitor drug, everolimus as systemic\ntherapy in that patient.18 Ourowneffortstoperformnext\ngeneration testing, after 2 failed attempts showed a FOSB-\nACTB gene fusion thought to be supportive of the histologic\ndiagnosis of PMH (personal communication with Denis\nAdams, Harvard).\nUSE OF SIROLIMUS: No systemic therapies are\nFDA approved for treatment of PMH. However, sirolimus\nis one of the ﬁrst systematic agents to show efﬁcacy in the\ntreatment of complex vascular malformations. SIR inhibits\nmTOR by allosteric interaction with the FK506 binding\nprotein, although its full mechanism(s) of action are felt to\nbe incompletely understood. The mTOR pathway is\ninvolved in regulation of a wide range of crucial cell func-\ntions, including angiogenesis, cell division, cell motility, and\nprotein synthesis, and responds to a wide range of inputs,\nnotably tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGFr and the\nPI3k/AKT axis.26,27 As such, SIR and its analogues have\nbeen the subject of considerable interest in the treatment of\nneoplastic disease. In some studies constituent endothelial\ncell overexpression of targets of mTOR, such as cKit, have\nbeen identiﬁed.28 The exact role of these differences in gene\nexpression in the pathogenesis, progression, and response to\ntreatment with mTOR inhibition has not been elucidated.\nSirolimus has been a successful systemic agent in the\ntreatment of rare complex vascular malformations, including\nKaposiform hemangioendothelioma, which shares some fea-\ntures with PMH, forming the basis for our outside consultation\nand the recommend use and tolerability of SIR.26,28–30\nUse of Zoledronic Acid\nAs a bisphosphonate, Zoledronic acid has been found\nto have many beneﬁts in bone disease and thus given the\nunusually bony involvement for our patient and the very\nreal possibility of pathologic fracture and need for ampu-\ntation it was thought that ZA was reasonable to add to SIR.\nZoledronic acid inhibits osteoclast activity through com-\npetitive binding to hydroxyapatite crystal in sites of actively\nremodeling bone, preventing normal pyrophosphate-mediated\nresorption. ZA also contributes to osteoclast apoptosis by\ninhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase.21 Its hypothe-\nsized utility in cancer includes both mitigation of skeletal\ninstability because of metastases and disruption of the osteo-\nclast-supported microenvironment that favors tumor cell sur-\nvival, growth, and proliferation within primary and metastatic\nbony lesions. Recently, additional direct antitumor effects have\nbeen suggested21,31 although this remains poorly characterized.\nA study of bisphosphonate use in low-risk breast cancer\nshowed reduced incidence of bony metastases and overall\nmortality at 6-year follow-up21 and ZA has also shown efﬁcacy\nin reducing morbidity and rate of disease progression in\nmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and multiple\nmyeloma.31,32 Its utility in bony sarcomas has been promising\nin preclinical models31 and is well-tolerated in both adult and\npediatric populations.32,33 ZA is the subject of an ongoing\nphase II clinical trial in Ewing Sarcoma.34 However, no beneﬁt\nwas seen to adding ZA to standard chemotherapy in a\nrandomized phase III trial in osteosarcoma.35 In our patient\nwith PMH of bone who responded to therapy with ZA and\nSIR, it is not possible to determine the extent to which ZA\ncontributed to tumor response. However, it is possible to\nhypothesize that ZA contributed to protection against skel-\netal-related events (SRE), such as pathologic fracture in our\nefforts to avoid or delay ablative surgery.\nLimb Sparing in PMH\nLimb-sparing therapies attempted in previous cases have\nincluded surgery, radiation, and radiofrequency ablation\n(RFA) with their attendant morbidities, such as limb insta-\nbility, permanent tissue damage, risk of sarcoma induction\nand dysfunction in an active child. To our knowledge, this is\nﬁrst reported case of attempted limb sparing with systemic\ntherapy, where the other choices were felt to have too great a\nmorbidity by the family and the treating team.\nStudy Limitations\nAs with previous reviews, our review of children and\nyoung adults did not uncover any speciﬁc indicator(s) of\nmetastatic potential or any high-risk subpopulation. The\neffect of ZA and SIR on the patient’s long-term risk of\nmetastasis, recurrence, and progression, are not known nor\nare the long-term side effects. Potential long-term compli-\ncations/late effects of ZA and sirolimus potentially include\nosteonecrosis, renal impairment, reduced fertility, hyper-\ntriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.36–38\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe successful use of systemic therapy as primary\ntreatment for PMH is an important development both for\npatients who are ineligible for or refuse more aggressive\ntherapy and for patients who may receive greater beneﬁt\nwith combined systemic and local therapies than they would\nfrom standard wide excision alone. It is hoped systemic\ntherapy may mitigate risk of metastasis and, local recur-\nrence which exceeded metastasis as a consequence of failure\nof disease control. This report must be interpreted cau-\ntiously, as data on this disease remains limited and pre-\nviously reported outcomes of systemic therapy demonstrate\nmarked variation. Patients and families should be counseled\non these unknowns and be prepared to promptly escalate to\nthe more invasive standard of care in the event of treatment\nfailure. Patients who are offered systemic treatment such as\nSIR+ZA should be followed closely, and further research is\nrequired to inform providers as to the optimal frequency\nand duration of follow-up.

Three case reports of pediatric PHE showed that everolimus and sirolimus were effective as the first-line or later-line treatment.

Cóccaro\nPablo Roitman\nLucas R Brun\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) can be a challenge for diagnosis and might be confused with other tumors, such as epithelioid sarcoma. Here we present a case and a systematic review of the literature to identify and discuss PMH treatment in primary bone involvement. A 25-year-old woman was referred for bone pain (10/10) in the left lower limb. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple bone lesions (left femur, tibia, patella, ankle, and foot) with well-defined borders without signs of local aggressiveness. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) showed multiple metabolic musculoskeletal lesions in the left lower limb. A CT scan-guided biopsy was performed. Histological and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of PMH. After treatment with intravenous pamidronate (90 mg/monthly), the patient had clinical improvement, mild pain 2/10 without the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opiates. Follow-up was assessed by MRI and PET-CT. PET-CT showed metabolic resolution of most of the bone and muscular lesions and a significant improvement of the femoral lesion. MRI showed that the lesions in the left femur, tibia, and foot had a marked decrease in size without intravenous post-contrast enhancement and smaller lesions had disappeared. After a 3-year follow-up, PET-CT showed no metabolically active images. Literature review identified 31 records including 58 clinical cases of PMH with primary bone involvement and treatment description for qualitative analysis. Most lesions (69%) were treated by local excision or curettage. In addition, amputations were performed in a significant percentage of cases (20.7%). In the last years, mTOR inhibitors (n = 7) and anti-resorptive treatments (n = 4) were considered as alternative treatment options, especially in multifocal lesions.\nView\nShow abstract\n... 12 In contrast, several targeted drugs, such as sirolimus, everolimus, and telatinib, have shown efficacy with fewer side effects than chemotherapy. [12][13][14][15][16] Unfortunately, the low incidence of PHE does not allow investigators to perform systematic clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of a specific treatment, and long-term follow-up data for a specific treatment are limited. Therefore, no systemic therapies have been officially approved for the management of PHE. ...\n... 18 mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus and everolimus, have been effectively used for targeted therapy of PHE.

PHE are multicentric, locally aggressive, have low metastatic potential, and affect multiple tissue planes. Genetic aberrations are frequently detected in PHE and may play important roles in the occurrence, development, and treatment of this disease. In this study, we report a case of PHE with a novel SERPINE1‐FOSB fusion gene. The fusion introduced a strong promoter near the coding region of FOSB, resulting in overexpression of intact FOSB. Immunohistochemical analysis showed overexpression of pAKT and mTOR in tumor cells, suggesting activation of the PI3K‐AKT‐mTOR signaling pathway. The patient responded well to targeted therapy with sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. Our study correlated dysregulation of a specific signaling pathway and the effectiveness of a targeted therapy to a specific genetic aberration. This information may be useful for future investigations of targeted therapeutics and provide a potential predictive biomarker for therapeutic effectiveness in PHE cases.\nView\nShow abstract\nBeyond the rare: a case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma treated sequentially with everolimus, denosumab, and pazopanib\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nNov 2024\n\n\nDouglas Dias e Silva\n\nCamila Bobato Lara Gismondi\nMurilo Marques Almeida Silva\nRoberto Carmagnani Pestana\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is an ultra-rare vascular sarcoma that most commonly affects young adults, with a male predominance. It is diagnosed using a combination of imaging studies, histopathological examinations, and immunohistochemical staining. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, with the goal of achieving a wide local excision and reducing the risk of recurrence. The role of systemic therapies is not well established because of the rarity of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, uncertainty regarding its response to currently approved medications, and lack of randomized controlled trials. We describe the case of an 18-year-old male patient diagnosed with multifocal pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma of the left lower limb who was treated with everolimus in addition to denosumab, achieving a partial response that was consolidated with resection, radiofrequency ablation, and radiotherapy of multiple local lesions, achieving a long-lasting response. Following subsequent disease progression, the patient responded favorably to pazopanib, with no significant toxicities.\nView\nShow abstract\nPseudomyogenes Hämangioendotheliom der äußeren Genitalien: Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the external genitalia\nArticle\n\n\nMay 2024\n\n\nJiong Zhou\n\nDian‐He Yu\nXin‐Rong Chen\nSui-Qing Cai\n\nView\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the external genitalia\nArticle\n\n\nApr 2024\n\n\nJiong Zhou\n\nDian‐He Yu\nXin‐Rong Chen\nSui-Qing Cai\n\nView\nPrimary vascular tumors of bone: A comprehensive literature review on classification, diagnosis and treatment\nArticle\nFull-text available\n\n\nJan 2024\n\n\nIlaria Tortorelli\n\nElena Bellan\nBenedetta Chiusole\nAntonella Brunello\n\nView\nA case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma misdiagnosed as low-grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma and review of literature\nArticle\n\nMar 2022\n\nJ Cent S Univ Med Sci\n\n\nJundong Huang\n\nWei Shi\nJi Li\nYongbin Hu\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a rare angiogenic tumor. Histologically, the morphological characteristics of neoplastic vessels and endothelial differentiation are not obvious, and it is easy to be confused with epithelioid sarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and myogenic tumor. PHE usually occurs in arms and legs in young people and has a significant male predominance. The tumor has a predilection for the distal extremities and its typical manifestation is multiple center invasion of a single limb, which can involve all layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues,and is often accompanied by abvious pain. Histologically, PHE is characterized by infiltrative growth of tumor. Most tumor lesions are composed of sheets and loose fascicles of plump spindle or epithelioid cells within a background of variably prominent inflammatory infiltration, which was commonly composed of neutrophils. Some cells may resemble rhabdomyoblasts, and nuclear atypia and mitosis were rare. The tumor cells generally expressed positive cytokeratin (CK), ETS-related gene (ERG), Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) and integrase interactor 1(INI1). In some cases, the tumor cells expressed CD31. A case of a young woman was reported in this paper, who presented with a subcutaneous mass with severe pain and was chronologically misdiagnosed with herpes zoster, low-grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. In this study, the clinical and pathological features, differential diagnosis and the latest progress in therapy of PHE were analyzed based on relevant literature.\nView\nShow abstract\nSystematic review of sirolimus in dermatological conditions\nArticle\n\n\nJul 2021\n\n\nAndrew W Swarbrick\n\nAaron J Frederiks\nRachael S Foster\n\nSirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORI) with anti‐proliferative, antiangiogenic and immunosuppressive properties. While approved in Australia as an anti‐rejection medication for renal transplant patients, there is mounting evidence regarding the utility of oral and topical sirolimus in treating a plethora of dermatological conditions or conditions with cutaneous manifestations. Our aim was to present an overview of the evidence for current usage and breadth of the application of sirolimus in dermatology. We carried out a systematic review of all the literature published up to 31 August 2019 on oral and topical sirolimus with respect to dermatological conditions or conditions otherwise relevant to dermatology. While 3368 papers were initially produced in our search, 238 papers met our inclusion criteria and were examined in our review. The conditions examined were categorised into genodermatoses (9 conditions), infection (1 condition), inflammatory/autoimmune (10 conditions), neoplasm (3 conditions) and vascular (17 conditions). We extracted data on first author, publication year, journal, characteristics of the study and study patients, condition, drug modalities, drug efficacy, side effects, blood level of mTORI, co‐interventions and follow‐up. While there is level 1 evidence for the efficacy of sirolimus in conditions such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and GVHD prophylaxis, for many other conditions, the evidence is limited to level 4 evidence. Regarding oral systemic therapy, dosing regimens varied with the most common for children 0.8mg/m2 twice daily and for adults 1 mg twice daily. Doses were often adjusted to reach a typical trough level of between 5 and 15 ng/mL, though targets often varied. In the overall majority of cases, side effects were minimal or tolerable, including mucositis, cytopenias, lipid abnormalities and nausea/vomiting, and only a few cases had to stop due to adverse effects.

The pain was progressing and gradually worsening. A clear atrophy of the right vastus medialis as well as painful movement of the patella were observed clinically. \nRadiograph of the right knee depicted expansile, lobulated osteolytic lesions with sclerotic borders in femur, tibia and fibula. A pathologic fracture with periosteal reaction was depicted on distal metadiaphysis of the femur medially. (Figure 1). \nMRI showed septate, hyperintense lesions on T2W and hypointense on T1W images. A hyperintense periosteal reaction around femoral fracture was present (Figure 2). On PET/CT lesions were metabolically active (SUV max. 10.8) (Figure 3). Additional lesions were visible at patella, large trochanter, and individual foot bones. A biopsy of distal femur and immunohistochemical examination were required. A histopathological examination showed a diffusely infiltrative tumor composed of plump spindle and epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figure 4). Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for cytokeratin AE1AE3, ERG and FOSB, focally positive for CD31, negative for cytokeratin MNF116, and CAMTA1. A targeted RNA sequencing showed an ACTB-FOSB fusion, confirming the diagnosis of PMHE. MRI after therapy with sirolimus showed no changes in dynamics. \nPMHE is a very rare soft tissue tumour, with only 164 known cases, that mostly affects young men [1,-3,5,10-12].  PHME usually arises in soft tissues of the lower limbs (54%), less frequently in the upper limbs (24%), trunk (18%) or head and neck (4%) [4,5]. It most commonly presents as multiple discontinuous nodules (painful in 50 % of cases), typically involving multiple tissue planes, most often the dermis and subcutaneous layers [6,7]. Lesions of the deeper soft tissue and bone can cause symptoms related to the mass effect of the tumour [1]. It rarely metastasizes but a local recurrence or additional nodules in the same anatomic region appear in about 60% of patients [3,4]. The mortality rate is low and is to the best of our knowledge ranging from around 3-20%. These percentages are based on available follow-up data of previous studies [2,4]. \nOn imaging PMHE usually appears as lobulated and well-defined lesions [2]. Cross-sectional imaging has an important role in the diagnosis and localisation of the PHME due to the occurrence in different anatomic tissue planes [3]. On plain radiographs PMHE in bone appears as osteolytic expansile lobulated lesions without periosteal reaction, associated with well-defined borders and sclerotic rim. Osteolytic lesions may cause cortical destruction and pathological fracture of the affected bone. Oedema is easily observed when the tumour occurs in the epidermis or subcutaneous tissue. On CT scans osseous lesions are expansile osteolytic and well-demarcated without signs of bone destruction or periosteal reaction. Soft tissue lesions might appear as non-specific lobulated well-delineated masses. On MRI the lesions have low-intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images [3]. Intramuscular nodules can be identified on T1 fat-saturated post-gadolinium MR images as well-defined, hyperintense, enhancing foci. Whole body PET-CT is recommended due to frequent multicentric presentation of the disease. There could be a potential role of whole body MRI due to its great sensitivity, however the metabolic activity in lesions is easier to detect on PET-CT which displays an intensive FDG uptake [8]. To the best of our knowledge, all physicians used PET-CT for localisation of lesions rather than whole-body MRI. \nMicroscopic features of PHME include sheets of spindled to epithelioid cells, many tumour cells resemble rhabdomyoblasts [4,7]. By immunohistochemistry, PHME is positive for cytokeratin AE1AE3 and vascular markers ERG, CD31 (in about 50% of cases). Nuclear staining for FOSB in PHME shows either a SERPINE1-FOSB or an ACTB-FOSB fusion [6,7,9].\nTreatment includes wide excision of the lesion with adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy or chemotherapy). It usually has favourable prognosis but amputation of the limb may rarely be required due to local recurrence [6]. \nIn conclusion PMHE is a very rare soft tissue tumour with intermediate malignant potential [3]. The diagnosis is made by advanced immunohistochemical analysis and molecular confirmation in correlation with imaging findings. Recognition of PMHE is very important in order not to misdiagnose it as a more aggressive tumour (e.g., epithelioid sarcoma) [1,3].\nWritten informed patient consent for publication has been obtained.\n[1]\n\n                        Al-Qaderi A, Mansour AT (2019) Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma.

Extensive cases are treated with amputation as chemotherapy seems to be ineffective. Recently, promising results were published using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tumors of vascular origin. Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity. This case contributes to the growing evidence regarding the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, in multifocal PMH.\nKeywords: mTOR inhibition; pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; sirolimus.\n© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nEverolimus for Treatment of Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma.\nOzeki M, Nozawa A, Kanda K, Hori T, Nagano A, Shimada A, Miyazaki T, Fukao T.

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported case of PMH and the first successful and limb-sparing utilization of systemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma with bone and soft tissue involvement with favorable response to pamidronate: a case report and systematic review of the literature.\nBrance ML, Cóccaro NM, Roitman P, Castiglioni A, Agostinis F, Spense M, Scheitlin B, Rene N, Brun LR.

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported case of PMH and the first successful and limb-sparing utilization of systemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma with bone and soft tissue involvement with favorable response to pamidronate: a case report and systematic review of the literature.\nBrance ML, Cóccaro NM, Roitman P, Castiglioni A, Agostinis F, Spense M, Scheitlin B, Rene N, Brun LR.

Extensive cases are treated with amputation as chemotherapy seems to be ineffective. Recently, promising results were published using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tumors of vascular origin. Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity. This case contributes to the growing evidence regarding the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, in multifocal PMH.\nKeywords: mTOR inhibition; pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; sirolimus.\n© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nEverolimus for Treatment of Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma.\nOzeki M, Nozawa A, Kanda K, Hori T, Nagano A, Shimada A, Miyazaki T, Fukao T.

Histologically, PHE shows fascicular proliferation of eosinophilic spindle cells and/or epithelioid cells showing “pseudomyogenic” morphology. Immunohistochemically, PHE is usually positive for vimentin, cytokeratin, CD31 and ERG.\nMethod\nWe examined FOSB immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 27 cases consisting of 4 PHE and its histologic mimics including 6 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHE), 8 angiosarcomas (AS), 4 Kaposi sarcomas (KS) and 5 epithelioid sarcomas (ES). In addition, we performed IHC of CAMTA1 which has recently been established as a useful marker of EHE. We elucidated the diagnostic utility of FOSB IHC in the differential diagnosis of PHE and its histological mimics and also examined the usefulness of FOSB and CAMTA1 IHC combination in the differential diagnosis of the tumors.\nResults\nIHC revealed diffuse and strong FOSB expression in all PHE cases, while the other tumor types demonstrated limited, weak or no FOSB expression. All EHE cases exhibited diffuse and moderate to strong expression of CAMTA1. All tumor types except for EHE showed limited, weak or no CAMTA1 reactivity.\nConclusions\nDiffuse and strong FOSB expression was specific for PHE in the current series and FOSB IHC is an effective tool for differentiating between PHE and its histological mimics. Moreover, the combination of FOSB and CAMTA1 IHC is useful for distinguishing PHE from EHE.\nKeywords: Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, FOSB, CAMTA1, Immunohistochemistry, Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, Angiosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, Epithelioid sarcoma\nBackground\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is an unusual soft tissue tumor, defined as a vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that rarely metastasizes in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of soft tissue and bone tumors [1]. PHE mainly affects young adults and children with a remarkable male predominance. PHE tends to arise in the lower limbs, and less commonly in the upper limbs and trunk. Histologically, PHE consists of fascicular proliferation of spindle-shaped and/or epithelioid cells with oval to short-spindle nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm showing “pseudomyogenic” morphology. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells are usually positive for vimentin, cytokeratin, and some vascular markers including ERG and CD31, but they are negative for desmin and exhibited no myogenic differentiation. PHE has also been termed epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma according to its morphological similarity to epithelioid sarcoma (ES) by Billings et al. [2]. They described this peculiar vascular tumor as a variant of hemangoendothelioma, showing solid sheet and nest proliferation of round to slightly spindle cells with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor cells showed diffuse and strong cytokeratin expression on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and, therefore, they emphasized the importance of distinguishing between PHE and ES.\nEven though PHE has some characteristic histological features, we may have difficulty in distinguishing PHE from histologically similar vascular and epithelioid tumors of soft tissue including epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), angiosarcoma (AS), Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and ES, especially with small biopsy specimens. The precise diagnosis of PHE and distinguishing it from similar tumors is very important because the clinical behavior and malignant potential of these tumors are very different. We often use an IHC panel containing several vascular and epithelial markers for making the differential diagnosis of these tumors, although some tumors may show an overlapping immunoreactivity for these markers which sometimes makes it challenging to diagnose PHE. EHE is the most important tumor in the differential diagnosis of PHE, because its histological findings and clinical presentation are similar to those of PHE. Both of them usually show a fascicular proliferation of relatively bland spindle and/or epithelioid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. In addition, PHE tends to emerge with multiple musculoskeletal lesions, often involving skeletal bones [3] and EHE also has a tendency to form multifocal lesions in the bone.\nSome studies have clarified specific fusions of WWTR1-CAMTA1 or YAP1-TFE3 in EHE [4, 5]. The WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion derived from translocation of t(1;3)(p36;q25) and was often observed in most EHE cases. Moreover, recent studies revealed that the specific nuclear expression of CAMTA1 on IHC was a useful tool for the diagnosis of EHE [6, 7]. Alternatively, some studies revealed a specific SERPINE1-FOSB fusion derived from t(7;19)(q22;q13) and significantly higher FOSB mRNA expression in PHE tumor cells [8, 9]. Thus, FOSB is predicted to be a specific marker of PHE, although FOSB IHC in PHE has not been reported in detail.\nIn the present study, we elucidated the diagnostic utility of FOSB IHC in the differential diagnosis of PHE and its histological mimics including EHE, AS, KS and ES. We also performed CAMTA1 IHC, an excellent diagnostic marker for EHE [6, 7], and examined whether a combination of FOSB and CAMTA1 is useful for distinguishing these tumors.\nMethods\nPatients and pathological evaluation\nFor IHC, we chose 27 cases consisting of 4 PHEs, 6 EHEs, 8 ASs, 4 KSs, and 5 ESs from the pathology files of the Department of Surgical Pathology, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan. We used biopsy or resected specimens in various sites for the study. We reviewed all hematoxylin and eosin sections and checked previously performed IHC findings. After we confirmed that each case fulfilled the histological criteria and the results of IHC were consistent with each tumor type described above, we selected representative sections suitable for IHC.\nIn brief, PHE consisted of fascicular proliferation of bland, spindle-shaped cells that have oval nuclei and obvious eosinophilic cytoplasm showing myogenic differentiation (Fig. 1). On IHC, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CD31 and ERG, and were negative for myogenic makers including desmin and muscle specific actin HHF35. EHE also showed a bland morphology like PHE cases and consisted of fascicular proliferation of spindle-shaped cells, and occasionally had intracytoplasmic lumina, with an appearance like primitive vessels (Fig. 2a). Focally, the tumor had a myxoid stroma. The tumor cells of PHE were positive for epithelial and vascular markers on IHC. AS exhibited an apparent malignant morphology and was composed of solid and partly gland-like proliferation of spindle and/or epithelioid cells showing severe nuclear atypia and frequent mitotic figures. Some cases showed prominent epithelioid morphology and had been diagnosed as epithelioid AS (Fig. 2b). The tumor cells were positive for epithelial and vascular markers. KS exhibited multilobulated vascular lesions that consisted of fascicular proliferation of endothelial spindle cells with focal vascular channel formation in the dermis to subcutis (Fig. 2c). The tumor cells expressed several vascular markers including CD31, CD34, ERG and D2-40. All KS patients had no HIV infection, although they were in a compromised situation because of major surgery or long-term steroid medication, and showed nuclear HHV-8 reactivity in the tumor cells on IHC. ES consisted of fascicular and solid proliferation of spindle-shaped and epithelioid cells with oval nuclei and moderate nuclear atypia. The tumor cells were positive for AE1/AE3, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and CD34. The tumor cells were negative for INI1.\n\nRepresentative histologic findings of PHE. a PHE consisted of fascicular proliferation of bland, spindle-shaped cells that had oval nuclei and obvious eosinophilic cytoplasm showing pseudomyogenic differentiation. b Rhabdomyoblast-like cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm were sparsely observed. Epithelioid cells were also found\n\nRepresentative histologic findings of EHE, AS, KS and ES. a EHE showed bland morphology that resembled PHE cases and consisted of fascicular proliferation of spindle-shaped cells that occasionally had intracytoplasmic lumina, with the appearance of primitive vessels. b AS was composed of solid and partly gland-like proliferation of spindle and/or epithelioid cells showing severe nuclear atypia and frequent mitotic figures. This case showed prominent epithelioid morphology and was diagnosed as epithelioid AS. c KS exhibited multilobulated vascular lesions that consisted of fascicular proliferation of endothelial spindle cells focally forming a vascular channel. d ES consisted of fascicular and solid proliferation of spindle-shaped and epithelioid cells with oval nuclei with moderate nuclear atypia\nFOSB and CAMTA1 immunohistochemistry\nIHC was performed using primary rabbit monoclonal FOSB antibody (clone 5G4, dilution 1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and rabbit polyclonal CAMTA1 antibody (dilution 1:1000, Atlas Antibodies, Stockholm, Sweden). All slides were loaded into a PT Link module (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and subjected to an antigen retrieval/dewaxing protocol with EnVision FLEX Target Retrieval Solution (Dako) with pH 6.0 citrate buffer (FOSB) or pH 9.0 EDTA buffer (CAMTA1) before being transferred to an Autostainer Link 48 instrument (Dako). We then assessed the immunoreactivity of FOSB and CAMTA1 only if the tumor cells showed nuclear immunoreactivity. We semiquantitatively estimated the immunoreactivity according to the percentage of positive tumor cells approximately within a range of 10 %, and staining intensity was graded as weak, moderate or strong. Immunoreactivity was estimated by two observers (S.S. and T.H.).\nResults\nClinical information is summarized in Table 1. Patients’ age and sex were widely distributed. Three PHE cases showed bone lesions and 2 of them (Case 1, 2) had multiple bone lesions in one lower limb. Six EHE cases affected the liver (2 cases), bone (1 case), head (1 case) and extremities (2 case). Two cases with involvement of the liver (Case 7, 10) had multiple liver nodules. Five of 8 AS cases had involvement of the head, and bone was affected in 2 AS cases. All KS cases demonstrated multiple purpura in the extremities and/or trunk. The extremities were affected in all ES cases except for 1 genital case.\nTable 1.\nClinicopathological summary and results of FOSB and CAMTA1 IHC\nAbbreviations: PHE pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, EHE epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, AS angiosarcoma, KS Kaposi sarcoma, ES epithelioid sarcoma, mul multiple lesion; -, negative, NA not available\n\naThe patients (Case 1, 2) had multiple bone lesions in one lower limb\nOn IHC (Table 1), diffuse and strong expression of FOSB was observed in all PHE cases (Fig. 3a, b), while the other tumor types including 3 EHE, 6 AS, 4 KS and 3 ES cases demonstrated limited (10 %) and weak FOSB expression (Fig. 3c). Epidermal keratinocytes and endothelial cells in the background also showed weak FOSB expression although the intensity of FOSB expression in these cells was apparently different from that in PHE (Fig. 3c). No FOSB expression was observed in the 3 EHE, 2 AS and 2 ES cases. On the other hand, all EHE cases exhibited diffuse and moderate to strong expression of CAMTA1 (Fig. 3d). Five AS and 1 KS showed limited (10 %) and weak CAMTA1 expression. All PHE cases except for 1 with missing available slides were negative for CAMTA1. Moreover, 3 AS, 3 KS and 5 ES cases exhibited no CAMTA1 expression.\nFig. 3.\n\nImmunohistochemistry of FOSB and CAMTA1. a Tumor cells of PHE showed diffuse and strong nuclear expression of FOSB (Case 3). b Tumor cells of PHE showed diffuse and strong nuclear expression of FOSB. This section was obtained from a bone lesion and underwent decalcification. Positivity of FOSB was preserved after the decalcification process (Case 4). c Tumor cells of KS showed limited and weak FOSB expression. Its positivity was apparently different from that in PHE. Epidermal keratinocytes and endothelial cells in the background were positive for FOSB. These findings should be carefully distinguished from true FOSB positivity in tumor cells (Case 22). d Tumor cells of EHE exhibited diffuse and strong nuclear expression of CAMTA1 (Case 9)\nDiscussion\nSome studies revealed that PHE has a novel fusion gene of SERPINE1-FOSB derived from translocation of t(7;19)(q22;q13) and established PHE as a genetically distinct entity [8, 9]. Walther et al. also demonstrated that FOSB mRNA expression in PHE cases was significantly higher than other soft tissue tumor cases, and predicted that SERPINE1-FOSB fusion provided a promoter that allowed the strong expression of FOSB [9]. Ide et al. have recently reported a rare penile PHE case with SERPINE1-FOSB fusion detected by RT-PCR [10], and demonstrated strong nuclear expression of FOSB on IHC in the tumor cells. In our study, only PHE cases showed diffuse and strong positivity for FOSB, while cases of EHE, AS, KS and ES exhibited limited or no expression of FOSB on IHC. There was a notable difference of FOSB positivity between PHE and other tumor types. Furthermore, FOSB showed well-defined nuclear expression and its reactivity was preserved in specimens from decalcified bone. This suggested that FOSB is a specific marker of PHE and FOSB IHC is a convenient and effective tool for excluding PHE from other vascular and epithelioid tumors of the soft tissue. Moreover, all PHE cases except for 1 with missing available slides were negative for CAMTA1. On the contrary, all EHE cases demonstrated diffuse and moderate to strong CAMTA1 expression without strong FOSB reactivity. Based on the results, the combination of FOSB and CAMTA1 IHC could be a useful diagnostic tool for distinguishing PHE from EHE.\nFOSB expression was often observed in various background cells which often intermingled with tumor cells; therefore, such positivity in background cells may have misled us into placing a higher valuation of FOSB expression. FOSB is one of the transcription factors of the FOS family proteins that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. The FOSB protein can form dimers with proteins of the JUN family and they consist of major components of activating protein 1 complex that regulates various kinds of gene expression. Several reports have described FOSB expression in normal tissues on IHC. FOSB expression was detected in normal epithelial cells of mammary lobules and terminal duct, and stromal fibroblasts in mammary gland tissue [11]. FOSB is also expressed in intermediate trophoblasts in the placenta [12] and epidermal keratinocytes of the skin [13]. In addition, FOSB is widely expressed in bony and cartilaginous tissue in developing bone, whisker follicles, liver, and epidermal tissue in fetal mice [14]. In the present study, FOSB was sometimes expressed in endothelial cells, keratinocytes of the epidermis and hair follicles, and some stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, we had some difficulty in estimating the true FOSB positivity in tumor cells except for PHE. We could precisely estimate FOSB expression in tumor cells because the intensity of FOSB expression in background cells was stronger than that in tumor cells in EHE, AS, KS and ES cases which showed limited, weak or no reactivity of FOSB. In addition, the reactivity was obviously weaker than that in PHE tumor cells. We should check HE stained sections corresponding to IHC specimens to confirm whether FOSB-positive cells are tumor cells. Moreover, such background cells would be a useful internal positive control for FOSB IHC if we could carefully assess the true positivity of FOSB.\nConclusion\nDiffuse and strong FOSB expression was specific for PHE in the current series and FOSB IHC is an effective tool in the differential diagnosis of PHE. Moreover, the combination of FOSB and CAMTA1 IHC is a useful panel for distinguishing PHE from EHE.\nAbbreviations\nPHE, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; EHE, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; AS, angiosarcoma; KS, Kaposi sarcoma; ES, epithelioid sarcoma; IHC, immunohistochemistry\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank the following pathologists for kindly contributing case material and clinical follow-up information: Aya Sasaki, Division of Diagnostic Pathology, Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Masaharu Fukunaga, Department of Pathology, Jikei University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Reiko Watanabe, Division of Pathology and Clinical Laboratory, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Ichiro Ito, Division of Diagnostic Pathology, Shizuoka Cancer Center, Shizuoka, Japan; and Takanori Hirose, Division of Diagnostic Pathology, Hyogo Cancer Center, Hyogo, Japan.\nFunding\nNo funding.\nAvailability of data and materials\nAll data were presented in this paper and there were no additional supporting files.\nAuthors’ contribution\nSS participated in the design of the study, performed the pathological analysis, and drafted the manuscript.

This tumor is rare; therefore, detailed information regarding this tumor is still lacking.\nHere, we report a case of a man in his 20s presenting with left foot pain for about one year. Imaging showed a 2-cm ovoid, cortically based lesion with a lytic defect of the cortex at the fifth metatarsal proximal shaft. Histologically, the lesion presented as an infiltrating proliferation of distinctly myoid-appearing spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and mildly atypical vesicular nuclei. Scant mitoses were identified with no areas of necrosis. Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin expression as well as CD31 and ERG. CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells, and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present.\nOver half of the patients with PMH develop multifocal lesions, often involving several tissue planes; however, distant metastasis is very infrequent. This patient underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the prognosis of these lesions.\nKeywords: solitary lesion, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, indolent, vascular, sarcoma, epithelioid, hemangioendothelioma\nIntroduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is an endothelial neoplasm, mostly indolent and with low-grade malignancy, having several different classifications. The current nomenclature was originally described by Hornick and Fletcher (2011), in which its myoid and epithelioid-like histologic pattern is defined as \"pseudomyogenic\" [1]. It is predominantly found in young adult males, at approximately 30 years of age, and in the distal extremities [1]. This vascular neoplasm is multifocal and can involve the dermis, subcutis, and bone [2]. The multifocality of these tumors tends to involve the same local anatomical regions as the original tumor [3]. This tumor is rare; therefore, investigation for additional detailed information regarding this tumor is warranted.\nCase presentation\nA male in his 20s presented with increasing pain in his left foot for the past year. He had a history of hypertension but had no other medical problems or trauma. A physical exam revealed tenderness over the fifth metatarsal, particularly at the proximal shaft. There was no warmth, erythema, or lymphadenopathy, and a reassuring distal neurovascular exam. Plain X-rays revealed a 2-cm ovoid lytic lesion in the fifth metatarsal, with a saucer-like deformity and significant scalloping, favoring reparative granuloma, chondroma, periosteal desmoid, or other neoplasms (Figure 1). The lesion was also identified on CT and MRI. A biopsy of the lesion was taken at the time of surgery.\nFigure 1.

Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin AE1&3 expression, as well as CD31 and ERG (Figure 3). CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells (Figure 3), and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present.\nFigure 3.

These findings are consistent with an epithelioid sarcoma-like epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), with a differential diagnosis including epithelioid vascular neoplasm and epithelioid sarcoma. The retention of INI1 expression, strong CD31 positivity, and lack of diffuse CD34 argue against epithelioid sarcoma, which was described as PMH.\nThe decision was made to treat the lesion with debridement, curettage, grafting, and internal fixation. Post-surgical follow-up positron emission tomography (PET) scans were negative, and CT scans have shown progressive healing of the pathologic fracture and the cavitating cortical lesion (Figure 4). There was no evidence of recurrent tumor, including local recurrence or local spread to other sites after seven years of follow-up.\nFigure 4.

PMH can be asymptomatic, but the most common symptom is pain in the region of the tumor [4]. It most commonly occurs in the dermis and subcutis tissue layer, yet approximately half of the cases have intramuscular lesions, and 20% are intraosseous [1]. Grossly, 70% of these lesions are multifocal, unlike in this case as a solitary lesion, and average in size between 1 and 2.5 cm [2,5]. It is a mostly indolent tumor with a low likelihood to metastasize, as also demonstrated in this case [1]. The main treatment for PMH is debridement; however, chemotherapy is also used. Targeted angiogenic drugs have been proposed, specifically as a treatment for vascular tumors. Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitor drug in which mTOR is prevented from activating protein synthesis and angiogenesis. Sirolimus (rapamycin) and derivatives have been predicted to be an effective and less toxic treatment compared to chemotherapy for PMH [2].\nHistologic morphology of PMH consists of neoplastic cells that are enlarged, spindled, and with bright eosinophilic cytoplasm that can mimic rhabdomyoblasts. They contain mild nuclear atypia and infrequent mitotic activity [1,6].\nPMH has an inclusive differential diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteoblastoma, and vascular tumors [4]. PMH has presenting similarities with epithelioid sarcomas, such as presenting in the skin and soft tissue in the distal extremities and having diffuse keratin positivity [1]. This case represents the importance of identifying and distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors with poorer prognoses. To differentiate between PMH and epithelioid sarcoma, as both have cytokeratin positivity, epithelioid sarcoma expresses MNF116 and AE1&3 and has a loss of expression of INI1 (90%) and CD34 (50%) [3,7]. PMH is also negative for pan-cytokeratin, EMA, and CD34, in which 50% are positive in epithelioid sarcoma [1,3,7]. Histologically, PMH can mimic other skeletal muscle tumors; however, PMH lacks expression for actin, MyoD1, and desmin [1,6,8]. PMH usually shows reactivity with vascular markers, including CD31, FLI1, and ERG, as well as co-expresses vimentin and keratins such as AE1&3, CK7, and CAM5.2 [6].\nAnother useful tool in the diagnosis of PMH is the use of FOSB immunohistochemistry. The FOSB expression for PMH is strongly positive [9]. The SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusion due to the chromosomal translocation t(7;19)(q22;q13) has been identified in several cases [6,10]. The WHO 2020 classification reported on recently identified genetic alterations in which PMH has SERPINE1-FOSB and ACTB-FOSB, which can be useful when distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors [10]. The differential diagnosis for PMH can be broad, and the rarity emphasizes the importance of immunohistochemical stains and increases the possibility of being overlooked.\nConclusions\nPMH is a rare neoplasm, particularly with the involvement of the bone. It is characterized as a multifocal, male-predominant tumor with predominantly spindled epithelioid morphology and positive keratin markers. We presented a patient who underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the importance of the identification of these lesions and their effects on treatment and prognosis.\nThe content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

PHE typically has a multifocal presentation and can involve several tissue planes, including the dermis, subcutis, muscle and bone.\nMethods and results\nWe present here a unique case of PHE/ESH that arose in the breast as well as a review of the published literature. The initial biopsy was interpreted as a metaplastic carcinoma. However, complete resection largely revealed plump epithelioid cells, and a more spindled cell component was also noted. The cells displayed abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and central vesicular nuclei arranged in loose fascicles, with a mild, mixed acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Overall, linear membranous staining of CD31 and lack of CD34 expression were highly suggestive of PHE. At the same time, FOSB immunoreactivity was observed, which supported PHE/ESH instead of metaplastic carcinoma. The patient has not shown recurrence in the half year follow up after total mastectomy.\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of breast involvement in this neoplasm. Recognition of its histopathological features and immunohistochemical reactivity will prevent misdiagnosis of breast lesions.\nKeywords: Breast, Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, Epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, CD31\nBackground\nIn 2013, Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE)/epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma (ES-H) has been accepted as a new vascular fumor entity by WHO. PHE/ESH is a distinct, uncommon tumor with an endothelial phenotype that usually arises in soft tissue, and its biological behavior is intermediate between a benign hemangioma and a fully malignant angiosarcoma [1]. Histologically, PHE/ESH is characterized by ill-defined nodules of plump spindle and epithelioid cells with abundant densely eosinophilic cytoplasm that grow in sheets and fascicles [2]. PHE/ESH has no distinctive clinical features and is difficult to diagnose pathologically, especially when there is no architectural evidence suggestive of endothelial differentiation. At the same time, its vascular differentiation is essentially inapparent, with no well-formed vessels and only rare intracytoplasmic lumens, which makes this tumor type extremely difficult to diagnose. Approximately half of the patients in the largest published series were clinically misdiagnosed with other pathologies [3]. Therefore, increased awareness of this new entity is essential for both clinicians and pathologists.\nIn this article, we describe a rare case of PHE/ES-H of the breast first misdiagnosed as metaplastic carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first case of PHE/ESH in breast. The present study demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma due to an exceedingly unusual location of PHE/ESH appearing as breast metaplastic carcinoma.\nCase presentation\nIn July 2018, a 43-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with the complaint of a mass and pain in her left breast. No significant signs were observed in her past medical and family histories. MRI revealed several masses on her left nipple, the lateral quadrant of the left breast, and the outer upper quadrant of the left breast. No palpable mass was detected in the other breast or axillae. Hence, a tru-cut biopsy was performed.\nThe biopsy pathology revealed a solid, deep dermal and superficial subcutaneous mass consisting of relatively bland spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and moderately enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei. Atypia and mitotic figures were inconspicuous. Acute and chronic inflammatory cells were present throughout the lesion; in particular, the stroma contained prominent neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 1a).\nFig. 1.\n\nMicrophotograph of tumor tissue by FANB. a. Loose fascicles of bland spindle cells with neutrophils scattered in the stroma (H&E, 200x). b. Rhabdomyoblast-like appearance of tumor cells with brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm (H&E, 200x). c. Strong extensive expression of AE1/AE3 in the neoplastic cells (200x). D.CD 34 were negative in tumor cells (200x)\nThe cells of interest were immunoreactive for AE1/AE3 (AE1/AE3, dilution 1:400; Gene Tech) and negative for SMA (1A4, dilution 1:1600; Gene Tech), Desmin (D33, dilution 1:200; Gene Tech), CD34 (QBEnd10, dilution 1:800; Gene Tech), ALK1 (ALK1, dilution 1:200; DAKO), S100 (2A10, dilution 1:400; IBL), β-catenin (E247, dilution 1:400; Gene Tech), and P63 (4A4, dilution 1:1000; Gene Tech). The Ki-67 (MIB-1, dilution 1:30; Biogenex) score demonstrated a low proliferation rate of tumor cells (1/10 HPF). The initial diagnosis was metaplastic carcinoma of the breast with no lymph node metastasis. Biomarker assessment revealed a triple-negative status. ER (SP1, dilution 1:1; Roche), PR (1E2, dilution 1:1; Roche) and c-erb-B2 (4b5, dilution 1:500; Ventana) were all negative. Total mastectomy was performed. The pathology was essentially the same as in the previous study, except for focal myxoid changes in the matrix. Moreover, the tumor cells exhibited a prominent epithelioid cytomorphology with a striking resemblance to rhabdomyoblasts (Fig. 1b). Therefore, more immunohistochemical analyses were performed, including for CD31 (JC70A, dilution 1:400; Gene Tech), FLi-1 (MRQ-1, dilution 1:100; ZATA), ERG (EPR3864, dilution 1:200; ZATA), INI-1 (25, dilution 1:200; ZATA), and FOSB (5G4, dilution 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology) (Fig. 2). AE1/AE3 analysis was repeated. The tumor cells were strongly and diffusely positive for AE1/AE3, FLi-1, ERG and FOSB. In situ hybridization for TFE3 (Z-2109-50; ZytoVision) and c-Myc (05 J91–001; Abbott-Vysis) was also performed. Most of the cells were also positive for CD31, with a linear membranous pattern. The neoplastic cells maintained intact expression of INI-1. FISH results were negative for c-Myc amplification and for TFE3 translocation, which ruled out epithelioid angiosarcoma (EAS) and epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHEs). This immunophenotype supported the vascular nature of the neoplasm in tissue and the final diagnosis of PHE/ESH was made. Furthermore, tumor cell embolus and multiple lesions were found, and lactation surgery was not considered (Fig. 3).\nFig. 2.\n\nImmunohistochemical panel performed on the total mastectomy material. The neoplastic cells showed linear membranous staining of CD31 (a) and lacked of CD34 expression (b). The neoplastic cells showed strong and diffuse degrees of positivity for ERG (c)\nFig. 3.\n\nHE (a) and immunoreactivity of AE1/AE3 (b) showed a tumor cell embolus (200x)\nDiscussion\nIn 1992, Mirra et al. [4] firstly described five cases of an unusual multifocal soft tissue tumor and called the unique lesions as “the Fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma”, describing it as a “fibrohistiocytic/myoid cell lesion often confused with benign and malignant spindle cell tumors”. In 2003, Billings et al. [3] described seven distinct cases of a low-grade vascular tumor and proposed renaming this tumor “epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma”, which was based on the presence of large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm upon microscopy with keratin positivity. Based on a series of 50 patients and the advent of newer immunohistochemical markers, Hornick and Fletcher [5–7] subsequently proposed changing the terminology to PHE/ESH, confirming its vascular origin and indolent behavior. In 2013, the current World Health Organization classification of soft tissue and bone listed PHE/ESH as an intermediate, rarely metastasizing, vascular tumor with peculiar clinical and pathological features [8].\nIn general, this neoplasm appears to be more common in males than in females (4.6:1) and typically occurs in men between 20 and 50 years of age. Clinically, PHE/ESH most commonly presents as multiple nodules in one anatomic region involving the soft tissues of the upper and lower extremities, but lesions may also arise in the trunk, spine, head, neck, bone and oral cavity [9–13]. Our patient is the first reported case of PHE presenting in the breast. There were several lesions on the nipple of the left breast, the lateral quadrant of the left breast, and the outer upper quadrant of the left breast. Histopathologically, PHE/ESH resembles a neoplasm with ill-defined nodules of plump spindle-shaped and epithelioid cells with abundant densely eosinophilic cytoplasm that grow in sheets and fascicles, sometimes mimicking rhabdomyoblasts. This infiltrative tumor often has a stromal neutrophilic infiltrate and sometimes also has a focal myxoid change in the matrix. Unlike other vascular tumors, PHE/ESH lacks multicellular vascular channels or intralesional hemorrhage. Cytologic atypia is typically mild to moderate, though rare cases have exhibited severe atypia. Mitotic activity is low, with most tumors having fewer than 5 mitoses per 50 HPFs or a mean mitotic rate of 2/10 HPFs [13]. Our case had a mean mitotic rate of 1/10 HPFs. The neoplastic cells usually express cytokeratin AE1/AE3, FLI-1, ERG and are negative for Desmin and S100. Furthermore, CD34 negativity is observed, which differentiates it from other vascular tumors such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma or epithelioid angiosarcoma. Most notably, the tumor cells in our case were also positive for CD31, with linear membranous staining, which may facilitate diagnosis. Recently, the specific balanced translocation t (7; 19) (q22; q13) resulting in the fusion of the SERPINE1 and FOSB genes was reported. This SERPINE1- FOSB gene fusion might lead to strong expression of FOSB, and identification of this genetic derangement is useful for diagnostic purposes [14, 15]. In our case, the tumor cells expressed CD31, AE1/AE3, FLi-1, and ERG and were negative for CD34. More importantly, FOSB overexpression was observed, which is consistent with the literature.\nOncologists are becoming more aware of PHE/ESH. However, it is still easily misdiagnosed. In fact, approximately half of the patients in the largest published series were clinically diagnosed with various other pathologies [6], such as epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and EHE. These three tumors are particularly aggressive, and it is thus important to distinguish PHE. In general, ES, EHE and PHE share certain features: they all affect the young, show epithelioid and spindle cell morphology, and express FLI1 and ERG to varying degrees. PHE/ESH always has a neutrophil background, whereas the other two tumors are negative. Except for the immunophenotypic overlap, ES typically lacks reactivity for CD31 and lacks SMARCB1 (INI-1) expression, unlike PHE/ESH. The WWTR1-CAMTA1 mutation is found in EHE, which is absent in PHE/ESH. Additionally, leiomyosarcoma shows reactivity to Desmin, Actin and Myogenin, but vascular markers are not expressed.\nConsidering all spindle cell lesions occurring in the soft tissues can occur in the breast with overlapping morphologies for different category of lesions so it is important to consider a wide differential diagnosis. In our case, it is easily to rule out diagnoses of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), aggressive fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis (NF), solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), since it is negative for ALK (5A4), β-catenin, SMA, Desmin, and CD34. But one of the most important differential diagnoses is metaplastic carcinoma. Our case was first misdiagnosed as metaplastic carcinoma because of its specific location and its immunochemical panel. Moreover, PHE/ESH has no unique radiological, the exact diagnosis can only be made on histopathologic examination. Neither fine-needle aspiration cytology nor core needle biopsy easily diagnoses PHE/ESH because it is difficult to obtain representative cells for a correct diagnosis by these techniques [16]. Histologically, both tumors share the same features, such as many spindle cells, mild to moderate nuclear atypia, and mitoses, with diffuse expression of keratins and lacking expression of ER, PR, and c-erb-B2. Metaplastic carcinoma, especially spindle cell carcinoma is characterized by atypical spindle cells, arranged in a multitude of architectural patterns raging from long fascicles in herringbone or interwoven patterns to short fascicles in a storiform pattern [17]. Infammatory infiltrate is often found in a proportion of cases, but usually with lymphocytes and dendritic cells not neutrophils. Clearly, vascular markers are not expressed in metaplastic carcinoma. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is not difficult if we are aware of this rare clinical entity in the breast.\nPHE/ESH is a locally recurrent, rarely metastasizing tumor. A total of 82 patients with PHE/ESH have been reported, with follow-up available for 61 (74%); only 3 patients (5%) developed distant metastasis at 4, 8.5 and 16 years after the initial diagnosis. Almost half of patients had local recurrence or new lesions in the same region as the initial tumor, especially in the first year after diagnosis [18]. The efficacy of treatment is only partially known and still the object of study. Surgical excision is the first therapeutic choice for PHE/ESH, followed by chemotherapy or radiation. Most cases can be treated with wide local excision; however, amputation may be recommended for patients with extensive multifocal disease. Moreover, over one-third of patients exhibit relapse after surgery [19]. Based on this, systemic treatment is most likely necessary. Regardless, there are no guidelines because PHE/ESH is so rare. Different systemic therapies (Table 1) have been described in case reports in the literature. Among them, inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) show major efficiency [1, 11–13, 20, 21] in cases of progressive metastatic and relapsing multifocal PHE/ESH resistant to multiagent chemotherapy. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase regulated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), acts as a master switch for numerous cellular processes, such as cellular catabolism and anabolism, motility, angiogenesis and growth. Several members of the PI3K/mTOR pathway have been implicated in the generation and propagation of vascular anomalies. As inhibitors of mTOR target protein synthesis downstream of the Akt pathway, they are predicted to be effective in disorders in which mTOR pathway-mediated growth control is affected. PHE/ESH is associated with the specific translocation t (7; 19) involving the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion gene. SERPINE1 encodes a serine protease inhibitor family protein, known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which is reported to inhibit apoptosis by activating the Akt pathway [22]. Akt functions just upstream of mTOR and is overexpressed in endothelial cells of murine models of cutaneous vascular malformations. Therefore, inhibition of mTOR might constitute a target for therapy in the future. In our case, after total mastectomy, the patient did not show recurrence in the half year of follow-up.\nTable 1.\nDifferent treatments for PHE/ESH in the literatures\n\nAbbreviations: CP Cyclophosphamide, PD Prednisolone, CS Cisplatin, GM Gemcitabine, DX Docetaxel, PL Paclitaxel, DO Doxorubicin, VN Vincristine, AC Actinomycin, IF Ifosfamide, EP Epirubicin, ET Etoposide, CB Carboplatin, EC Electrocauterization, UN Unknown\nConclusion\nIn summary, we present a unique case of PHE/ESH in the breast. Although extremely rare, PHE/ESH can present in the breast mimicking breast carcinoma. A high degree of suspicion is required to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. In view of the high incidence of local recurrences, continued close follow-up of the patient is mandatory.\nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nAbbreviations\nEpithelioid angiosarcoma\nEpithelioid hemangioendotheliomas\nEstrogen receptor\nEpithelioid sarcoma\nEpithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor-2\nInflammatory myofibroblastic tumor\nInhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin\nNodular fasciitis\nPlasminogen activator inhibitor-1\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma\nPhosphoinositide-3-kinase\nProgestogen receptor\nsolitary fibrous tumor\nAuthors’ contributions\nYan Ge made the final diagnosis and wrote the main parts of the report.

The aim of this study was to present a rare case of PHE in the back and to review its clinicopathological features, therapeutic modalities, evolutionary aspects and prognosis.\nCase presentation\nWe report the case of a 21-year-old man who consulted for a multinodular mass at the scapula level, that increased in size within 2 months. An excisional surgery was performed. Macroscopic examination showed ulcerated centimetric nodules with a crusty surface. Microscopic examination showed a multinodular proliferation arranged in clusters, made of spindle cells or epithelioid cells with variable atypia. Immunohistochemical study showed the expression ofAE1-AE3, ERG and INI-1. There was no staining for EMA, CD34, and CD-31. The diagnosis of PHE was retained.\nDiscussion\nPHE affects young adult males and usually develops in the extremities. Clinically, more than half of the patients present with local recurrence. Distant metastases have also been reported. Microscopically, PHE resembles a myoid tumor or epithelioid sarcoma because of the abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and cell shape. Tumor cells express cytokeratin and inconsistently CD34 and CD31. Hence the need to complete the study of ERG and INI1 expression in all soft tissue epithelioid tumors. The translocation t(7;19)(q22; q13) as well as the expression of FOSB in immunohistochemistry allow to differentiate with epithelioid sarcoma. Surgery is the treatment option.\nConclusion\nPHE is a confusing entity with several mesenchymal neoplasms that must be carefully differentiated.

Introduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE), a rare and recently discovered endothelial tumor, was formerly known as a fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma due to its physical resemblance to that tumor. PHE is an infrequently metastasizing intermediate-grade tumor, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2020 [1]. Young adults, particularly males, are often found to have PHE [2]. Although it can occur anywhere, this tumor often affects the extremities, mainly the lower limbs. The case of a young man diagnosed with PHE in the back reported here emphasizes the importance of a proper differential diagnosis in order to protect individuals whose PHE can be confused for more aggressive sarcomas. The aim of this study was to review clinicopathological features, emphasize on differential diagnosis and discuss therapeutic modalities and prognosis of this rare entity.\n2. Case presentation\nA 21-year-old man with no past medical or trauma history consulted for a back, at the scapula level, multinodular mass that increased rapidly in size within 2 months. A wide excision surgery was performed. Macroscopic examination of the skin specimen showed multiple ulcerated centimetric nodules with a crusty surface. Microscopic examination showed a multinodular proliferation arranged in clusters sometimes delimiting slits. It was made of spindle cells or epithelioid cells with brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm sometimes mimicking rhabdomyoblasts (Fig. 1). Tumor cells contained a nucleated nuclei with variable atypia. Mitotic figures were rarely observed without any atypical mitotic figure. No necrosis was noticed. The tumor ulcerated the epidermis, proliferated throughout the dermis, subcutaneous fat tissue and infiltrated the skeletal muscle in depth. The immunohistochemical study showed the expression of Cytokeratin (AE1-AE3) (Fig. 2), and INI-1. No staining for EMA, CD34 (Fig. 3), CD-31, PS-100 and Desmin was observed. ERG was positive in tumor cells (Fig. 4). The tumor was completely resected with safe margin status. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PHE was retained. A thoraco-abdominal pelvic scan was performed and showed no distant localization. No recurrence was observed six months after the resection. The patient will be followed every 6 months for 4 years with complete clinical examination.\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nHematoxylin and Eosin staining of a pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma.\nA: Tumor arranged in clusters composed of a mix of spindle and epithelioid cells (×100).\nB: Epithelioid and tumor cells showing mild nuclear atypia and rare mitosis (×400).\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells showing an intense and diffuse positivity for keratin AE1/AE3 (×400).\nFig. 3.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells negative for CD34 with positive internal control (×400).\nFig. 4.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells positive for ERG (×400).\nThe work has been reported in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria [3].\n3. Discussion\nSeveral publications have reported on the clinical and pathological features of PHE. Males are more likely than females to develop the tumor [2] and young adults in the third or early fourth decade have the highest incidence rates [2], [4]. In 60 % of the cases, it affects the lower body; the upper body and trunk are less frequently affected [5]. In our case, the lesion involved the back.\nPatients with PHE may present with pain in half of the cases or may be asymptomatic [5]. Our patient consulted for a back mass that increased in size rapidly.\nPHE can be multifocal, affecting several tissue planes in about two thirds of patients. Most patient's lesions are in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Tumor size ranges from a few millimeters to a few centimeters for PHE. Superficial lesions can manifest as ulcerated nodules mimicking an epithelioid sarcoma [6] or a dermatofibroma [7]. In our case, the lesion was centimetric and presented as nodules with a crusty surface.\nMicroscopically, the tumor's histological architecture is vaguely nodular, and it occasionally exhibits a desmoplastic reaction as it infiltrates the adipose or skeletal muscle tissue around it. The tumor cells are organized in sheets or short fascicles within a background of inflammatory infiltrates that vary in prominence and are typically made up of neutrophils, or less frequently, lymphocytes, plasma cells, or eosinophils. In exceptional cases, a myxoid background is observed. Tumor cells range from spindle to round and epithelioid. Transitional forms have been described [2]. Rhabdomyoblast-like cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei can be found in some areas. Regardless of the morphology, the cells usually feature a highly eosinophilic cytoplasm, bland nuclei with fine chromatin, and variably discernible nucleoli. Most cases of nuclear pleomorphism are mild to moderate; a few cases exhibit significant nuclear atypia. Typically, there are fewer than 5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields, although there have been certain cases where there have been more mitoses. Intratumoral hemorrhage or the development of vascular channels are often absent in the tumor. Geographic necrosis, a hallmark of epithelioid sarcoma, is uncommon. A few intracytoplasmic vacuoles suggestive of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma may occasionally be seen in rare situations [8].\nAlthough PHE expresses vascular immunohistochemistry antibodies, conventional hematoxylin-eosin examinations may not often show morphologic signs of vascular differentiation, and more researches are required to validate endothelial differentiation.\nPHE stains for Cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), ERG, FLI1, and FOSB [2], [9], [10]. Hornick et al. [2] reported that 22/47 cases expressed CD31. In some cases, it is possible to see focal staining for epithelial membrane antigen and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Importantly, integrase interactor 1 (INI-1) exhibits complete nuclear expression within every case. In this study, tumor cells expressed Cytokeratin (AE1-AE3), ERG and INI-1 and were negative for EMA, CD34, and CD-31 which is in accordance to literature.\nOn a molecular level, a balanced t(7;19)(q22;q13) translocation resulting in the fusion of the SERPINE1 and FOSB genes was discovered by Walther et al. [11] who employed cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, messenger RNA sequencing, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Fos family, which also includes the smaller splice variants Fra-1 and Fra-2, dimerizes with Jun proteins to form the AP-1 transcriptional factor complex, which includes FOSB. This family is associated with the occurrence of several malignancies, including colorectal, endometrial, and breast tumors [12]. Since SERPINE1 is thought to be a FOSB promoter and this translocation is exclusive to soft tissue tumors, it is thought to be pathognomonic for PHE [13].\nEpithelioid sarcoma is the most crucial differential diagnosis to rule out. Both epithelioid sarcoma and PHE share several clinical characteristics in common, including the tendency to affect young patients, preference for soft tissue in the distal extremities, epithelioid and spindle cell shape, and diffuse keratin expression. Additionally, FLI1 and ERG are positive in some epithelioid sarcoma patients. Epitheloid sarcoma is a more aggressive tumor than PHE with a higher propensity for local metastasis and recurrence [14]. Thus, it is crucial to distinguish between epithelioid sarcoma and PHE due to these differences. In addition to geographic necrosis, epithelioid sarcoma exhibits increased nuclear atypia. It generally lacks reactivity to CD31, FLI1, and INI-1. The absence or mild immunoreactivity for ERG can be beneficial, while epithelioid sarcomas are commonly ERG+ when antibodies against the N-terminus are used [15]. In addition, a study showed that 51/97 cases (52.6 %) of epithelioid sarcoma positive for CD34; while CD34 is consistently negative in PHE [8].\nIn some PHE cases, focal nuclear atypia and enhanced mitotic activity may prompt the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma. Most epithelioid angiosarcoma cases, unlike PHE, have vascular channels or cysts lined by malignant endothelial cells. Furthermore, as CD34 is often positive in angiosarcoma and negative in PHE, it will help in resolving that differential diagnosis.\nSurgery, including wide excision, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are used as treatment options. Distant metastasis only occurred in 3 patients (5 %) and was discovered 4, 8.5, and 16 years after the initial diagnosis. A second patient's concomitant squamous cell carcinoma caused their death [16]. Twenty-six patients (43 %) had new lesions or signs of a local recurrence in the same area as the original tumor; these recurrences were primarily noticed in the first year following diagnosis. Interesting though, a lot of the lesions remained unchanged throughout time [2], [7]. In this report, the patient is doing well, and no recurrence was observed six months after the resection.\n4. Conclusion\nPHE is a rare vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that has been documented in several body sites. It exhibits a clinical presentation resembling epithelioid sarcoma. It can be difficult to diagnose this tumor without morphologic evidence of a vascular pattern, thus an immunohistochemistry panel is needed. The clinical course of PHE appears to be variable, with frequent local recurrence but a low rate of distant metastases. Prolonged intervals of follow-up are advised due to the real, although slight, potential of distant metastasis developing several years after the initial diagnosis.\nEthical approval\nNo ethical approval.\nConsent\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The tumor has been reported in various locations in the body, including the head, neck, chest wall, abdominal wall, genital region, and extremities. Until now, there has been no indication of occurrence in the spine.\nMethods\nA 25-year-old male presented with spinal cord compression, due to an extradural tumor involving the third and fourth thoracic vertebrae with extension into the right pleural cavity.\nResults\nHistopathologic examination revealed a pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, also described as epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, or fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma.\nConclusion\nWe describe the first occurrence of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the thoracic spine. According to previous reports based on other locations, the tumor has an indolent clinical course with a small risk of metastasis, therefore complete macroscopic excision is the treatment of choice. Local recurrence may occur even with complete surgical resection, requiring close follow-up; adjuvant therapy is warranted.\nKeywords: Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, Epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, Fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma, Thoracic spine tumor\nIntroduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is a rare soft tissue tumor—distinct from epithelioid hemangioendothelioma [1]—originally described as a “fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma” [2]; it has been recently concluded that the “epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma” is essentially the same pathological entity [3]. Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma occurs predominantly in males between 20 and 50 years of age. Up to 78 % of tumors arise in the extremities, often affecting multiple tissue planes; dermis and subcutaneous tissue are most commonly involved, whereas intraosseous occurrence is rare, comprising not more than 20 % of the cases. Despite its ominous multifocal presentation, the tumor seems to have a relatively favorable long-term prognosis [4]. We present a case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma occurring in a new and entirely unusual localization, the thoracic spine.\nCase report\nHistory and examination\nA 25-year-old male presented with a history of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness during the last month. His past medical history and review of systems were unremarkable. He also complained of right-sided position- and activity-dependent chest pain. On neurological examination he had M 0/5 weakness of all muscle groups in the lower extremities, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, bilateral Babinski reflexes and increased muscle tone, representing spasticity. Sensory examination revealed pinprick sensory loss below the fourth thoracic dermatome, with preservation of deep pressure sensation.\nImaging studies\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine showed a large (4.5 × 3.5 × 3 cm3) mass involving the right costovertebral region of the fourth thoracic vertebra. The tumor extended into the right thoracic cavity and involved the right pedicle, transverse process, and rib. The lesion was multilobulated, isointense on T1-weighed images (T1WI), and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2WI. Following contrast administration it showed consistent enhancement (Fig. 1). The computed tomography (CT) of the involved region revealed two different morphologic patterns of tumor behavior with respect to bone. The tumor caused scalloping of the vertebral body without bone destruction, whereas it involved the pedicle, lamina, and transverse process, expanding these structures from within (Fig. 2). Preoperative angiography through the fourth thoracic segmental artery revealed an intensive tumor blush, which could be significantly reduced following embolization with polyvinyl alcohol (Fig. 3).\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fourth thoracic vertebral segment. a T1-weighed image (T1WI) illustrating the isointense mass extending into the right thoracic cavity, pedicle, transverse process, and rib. b Following contrast administration the mass enhances homogenously. c On T2WI the tumor is heterogeneously hyperintense\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nComputed tomography of the fourth thoracic vertebral segment on sagittal (a), coronal (b), and axial (c) images.

Macroscopically the tumor was solid, well circumscribed, and yellowish as it extended into the pleura. It became more fragile, bloody, infiltrating, and dark gray as it extended into the pedicle and transverse process. Its consistency was solid in the part causing scalloping of the vertebral body, where the tumor was easily peeling off from the corticalized surface of the vertebral body. Through right-sided costotransversectomy complete macroscopic resection of the tumor could be achieved (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nPostoperative imaging.

Scattered cells with vacuolated cytoplasm were also present. Prominent pleomorphic nuclei contained optically empty centers with peripheral marginalization of the chromatin, in addition to conspicuous nucleoli. Multinucleated cells were also present. Mitotic figures were relatively inconspicuous, in keeping with the low proliferation index (Ki-67). Occasional foci of cellular necrosis were also present. The large epithelioid cells resembled rhabdoid elements. The cells were oriented in a poorly defined, intersecting fascicular pattern, while the amorphic stroma assumed a bluish tinge or cast. Large blood vessels were visible within the stroma. These vessels branched into progressively smaller vascular elements, ultimately forming a network of small capillaries between the individual cells. Stains for keratin (AE1/3 and CAM5.2) were strongly positive, whereas CD31 immunohistochemistry (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule—PECAM-1) was focally positive. The negative S100 staining excluded the diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The tumor was desmin-negative and integrase interactor 1 (INI-1)-positive. The hematoxylin–eosin characteristics and immunohistochemistry staining profile of the tumor were conclusive for the diagnosis of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nHistopathological microphotographs of the tumor. a Epithelioid cells with vacuolated nuclei and prominent nucleoli (hematoxylin eosin, original magnification ×400). b Spindle cell component of the tumor with poorly defined fascicular pattern (hematoxylin eosin, original magnification ×200). c Prominent capillaries in the epithelioid part of the tumor (hematoxylin eosin, original magnification ×200). d immunohistochemistry for integrase interactor 1 protein (INI-1, original magnification ×400)\nDiscussion\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is a soft tissue tumor, named and extensively described by Hornick and Fletcher in 2011 [4]. It is generally accepted that this tumor is identical to the “fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma”, which was described in five patients by Mirra et al. [2]. Although the relationship of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma to “epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma” is subject to significant controversy and academic debate, they seem to be co-identical [3]. For those reasons, our literature search as to past-published cases included all three terms: pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma (Table 1).\nTable 1.\nReported cases of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma)\n| References | No. of cases | Locations |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Mirra et al.

The tumor is multifocal, involving different tissue planes and, although, it shares some histopathologic features with epithelioid sarcoma, it has a different, spindle cell morphology with common positivity for CD31, lack of CD34 reactivity, and intact INI-1 immunoreactivity [4, 5].\nThe molecular genetics of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is largely unknown with only one published study in the literature [6]. In a G-banding analysis of cultured metaphase tumor cells, Trombetta et al. showed a balanced translocation between chromosomes 7 and 19 [t(7;19) (q22;q13)] as the sole clonal change. Fluorescence in situ hybridization disclosed that the breakpoints were located within bacterial artificial chromosome clones RP4-747G18 in band 7q22.1, and CTB-171A8 in band 19q13.31-q13.32. The breakpoint region on chromosome 7 contained six genes (SERPINE1, APIS1, VGF, MOGAT3, PLOD3, and ZNHIT1), and the breakpoint on chromosome 19 contained four known genes (CEACAM19, CEACAM16, BCL3, and CBLC). Although the analysis of transcriptional directions of the genes allowed considering putative chimeric transcripts, the pathogenetic significance of these changes remains to be determined. Due to limited access to fresh tumor material, the authors also performed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, which showed unbalanced translocation der (7) t(7;19) in one out of nine analyzed cases. These results suggest that the translocation t(7;19) is of pathogenetic importance, however, only in a subset of tumors. The majority of pseudomyogenic hemangioendotheliomas seem to develop through other mechanisms [6].\nThe tumor has been described in various locations of the body, such as the head, chest wall, abdominal wall, genital region, and extremities [2, 4, 7–10]. No case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma has been reported in the spine (Table 1). In our patient the tumor involved several tissue planes including the thoracic vertebra, paravertebral muscles and the parietal pleura. During surgery, it was well-demarcated in its extension into the pleural cavity causing only scalloping, but no invasion of the vertebral body. Conversely, the tumor was more aggressive in its dorsal extension, infiltrating the vertebral pedicle, lamina, and transverse process.\nIn conclusion, we describe the first occurrence of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the thoracic spine. Based on previous reports in other locations, the tumor has a more indolent clinical course with a small risk of metastasis [4]. Therefore, complete macroscopic excision is the treatment of choice. Local recurrence must be considered, even with complete, gross surgical resection; close follow-up and adjuvant therapy is warranted.\nConflict of interest\nNone of the authors has any potential conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\n1.Ma J, Wang L, Mo W, Yang X, Xiao J.

Despite its initial categorization as a malignant entity, PMH often demonstrates an indolent behavior profile, and thus was classified as a rarely metastasizing endothelial neoplasm in the 2013 WHO Classification of Tumors of Soft Tissue and Bone. It is a tumor primarily of skin and soft tissue, with most reported cases involving the trunk or extremities. To date, only one case of PMH involving the oral cavity has been reported. Herein, we present a case of PMH involving the mandibular gingiva and vestibule of a 33-year-old female and discuss the salient features of this entity.\nKeywords: Oral, Pseduomyogenic, Hemangioendothelioma, Vascular tumor, Foreign body\nIntroduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is a vascular neoplasm of intermediate biological potential [1]. It was originally considered a fibroma-like variant of an epithelioid sarcoma; however, histomorphologic, immunohistochemical (IHC), and genetic analysis has led to the reclassification of PMH as a unique entity [2]. Distinct features of this neoplasm include a myoid spindle cell morphology, an endothelial IHC staining pattern, and a recurrent translocation (7;19) (q22:q13) [1, 3, 4]. PMH can arise in or involve any tissue layer including epithelium or mucosa, underlying dermis or connective tissue, muscle, or bone [5]. It is most commonly found on the extremities and skin of the trunk where it often presents as a variably painful nodule [1, 6]. A male predilection of approximately 4.6:1 has been reported [1]. Occurrences of PMH involving the head and neck region are exceedingly rare, and with regard to the oral cavity in particular, only one prior case has been described [1, 7]. Herein, we present a case of an oral PMH occurring in a 33-year-old female.\nCase Report\nA 33-year-old female in excellent overall health was referred to the Columbia University Medical Center Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for evaluation of a painful lesion of the anterior mandibular buccal gingiva. She stated that the area was debrided approximately four months prior by a local periodontist, who removed what was described as a “fishbone” from the site. No tissue was submitted for pathologic evaluation at that time. The surgical site failed to properly heal and the patient was placed on a topical corticosteroid therapy. The patient returned to her periodontist two months after the initial procedure, and a biopsy of the non-healing surgical site was performed. The lesion was diagnosed as “nonspecific inflammation and granulation tissue”. The patient was subsequently referred to our service for further management.\nUpon presentation, the patient was not in acute distress. Extraoral examination was within normal limits, with no evidence of trismus, swelling, asymmetry, or palpable lymphadenopathy. On intraoral examination, two distinct slightly raised, firm, red-white lesions were identified on the anterior buccal gingiva and vestibule adjacent to the right mandibular canine and first premolar (teeth #27 and 28). The lesions measured approximately 5 × 4 mm and 4 × 3 mm in size (Fig. 1). Based on the appearance of the lesions and the provided clinical history, a localized foreign body gingivitis was considered, and a re-biopsy of the site was recommended for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis.\nFig. 1.\n\nClinical photograph demonstrating two distinct red-white lesions (circled) involving the right mandibular facial gingiva and vestibule. The lesions measured approximately 5 × 4 mm and 4 × 3 mm in size and were painful to palpation\nHistologic examination of the specimen revealed surface epithelium overlying fibrous connective tissue. The fibrous connective tissues were infiltrated by plump spindle and epithelioid cells arranged in a loose fascicular and sheet-like pattern within a vascular, fibromyxoid background (Fig. 2a). The lesional cells appear to abut the surface epithelium with ample, albeit not clearly defined, cytoplasm and round to ovoid nuclei with smudged chromatin (Fig. 2b). Mitotic figures were not seen. IHC studies were performed and the lesional cells were diffusely and strongly positive for INI1 (Fig. 3a), CD31 (Fig. 3b), pan cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) (Fig. 3c), CD68, and ERG (Fig. 3d). The lesional cells were negative for S100, CD34, Factor XIIIA, SMA, and desmin. Due to suspicion of PMH, break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for the SERPINE1 and the FOSB loci were used to demonstrate the characteristic SERPINE1-FOSB translocation. Based on the histomorphology, IHC profile, and molecular studies, a diagnosis of PMH was rendered.\nFig. 2.\n\na Histologic examination revealed a mostly well-defined tumor within the fibrous connective tissue abutting the surface epithelium (H&E, × 20). b Higher power magnification of the tumor in relation to the epithelium (H&E × 100). c On high power magnification, perineural invasion is seen. The tumor consists of plump spindle and epithelioid cells with a rhabdomyoblast-like appearance within a vascular, loose fibromyxoid background intermixed with neutrophils (H&E × 400)\nFig. 3.\n\nImmunohistochemical profiling of the tumor cells showed them to be positive for a INI1, b CD31, c AE1/AE3, and d ERG (× 100)\nFollowing the diagnosis, the patient was sent for additional comprehensive studies prior to definitive treatment. Imaging studies showed no evidence of additional lesions. Definitive surgical management consisted of wide local excision with approximately 1 cm margins. Intraoperative frozen sections were utilized to assess the margin status at the time of resection. The patient is currently one year status post surgical treatment with no evidence of recurrence.\nDiscussion\nPMH is an endothelial neoplasm of intermediate biological potential first reported by Hornick and Fletcher [1]. Although initially described as a malignant entity, it has an indolent behavior profile, and may be more appropriately considered a neoplasm of intermediate biologic potential [1]. Prior to its classification as a distinct entity, PMH was referred to as a “fibroma like variant of epithelioid sarcoma” and “epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma” [2, 8]. Although the current case involved a young female, PMH has a strong predilection for young males, as demonstrated in Hornick and Fletcher’s [1] study of 50 cases which found a gender distribution of almost 5:1 (41 males to 9 females) and a median age at diagnosis of 31 years [1]. Other studies have reported similar age and gender profiles [9]. The most frequent sites of occurrence include the upper and lower extremities, trunk, and genitalia, with the head and neck representing one of the least frequently affected sites [1]. Lesions usually range from 0.5 to 5.5 cm in size and in approximately 50% of cases patients will report pain. More than half of the reported cases of PMH present with multiple nodules affecting the same anatomic region [1].\nThe clinical differential diagnosis of PMH can vary depending on location. When occurring extraorally, it may include both benign and malignant soft tissue neoplasms, including myofibroma, leiomyoma, benign fibrous histiocytoma, epithelioid sarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma [6]. The intermediate behavior profile of PMH can make it difficult to restrict a clinical differential to solely benign or malignant entities, and in all cases tissue biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Due to the scarcity of oral cases, it is difficult to establish a consistent clinical differential diagnosis. In the current case, a localized foreign body reaction was favored given the patient’s history. Given that PMH most often presents as a multinodular process in younger individuals, consideration could also be given to gingival fibromatosis, myofibromatosis, and multiple mucosal neuromas in the setting of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2B Syndrome.\nPMH has histologic overlap with many entities and thus histomorphologic differential diagnosis includes epithelioid sarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid angiosarcoma, myogenic tumors, and spindle cell/sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma. PMH has been described as a primarily spindle cell lesion with an infiltrative pattern. The spindle cells are typically arranged in loose sheets or fascicles and demonstrate vesicular nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm [7]. In some instances, the lesional cells have a distinctly rhabdomyoblast-like appearance. The tumor cells are often admixed within a vascular fibromyxoid background and variable amounts of neutrophils care commonly seen [7]. Features such as cellular pleomorphism and atypical mitoses are often not observed [7]. Although IHC profiling is required to definitively distinguish an epithelioid sarcoma from PMH, these two entities can also be separated on the basis of histomorphology. Epithelioid sarcoma lacks the plump, myoid appearing spindle cell morphology of PMH as well as its fascicular and sheet-like pattern [10]. The morphology of PMH also differs from that of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH). EH presents as epithelioid cells with occasional intracytoplasmic vacuoles arranged in cords in a myxohyaline stroma compared to the solid sheets and fascicles of spindle cells observed in PMH [10]. Epithelioid angiosarcoma (EA) can have histomorphologic overlap with PMH; however, EA has larger epithelioid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm when compared to PMH. EA also exhibits stromal hemorrhage and high nuclear pleomorphism, whereas PMH is limited to mild atypia. Spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma (scSCC) may also share histologic similarities with PMH. scSCC has a biphasic carcinomomatous and sarcomatoid cellular morphology, in which the normal nesting pattern of conventional squamous cell carcinoma can be lost. Thus a predominantly spindle cell population found in sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma can appear similar to the spindle cell population seen in PMH. However, the high grade nuclear features and high mitotic activity can be used to help distinguish this entity from PMH [11]. Lastly, PMH frequently exhibits rhabdomyoblast-like cellular features with eosinophilic cytoplasm, wavy nuclei, and spindle morphology thus myogenic tumors such as leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyoma, rhabdomyosarcoma may be included in the histologic differential.\nAlthough histomorphologic subtleties may be helpful in differentiating PMH from other entities, immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis are required for definitive diagnosis. The tumor cells of PMH consistently stain positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, FLI-1, and INI-1 [7]. The cytokeratin AE1/AE3 stain is theorized to highlight the epithelial differentiation of PMH, but studies have shown that endothelial cells in vascular tumors may stain positive for keratins and thus this could represent innate keratin formation rather than true differentiation [12]. Furthermore, Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 is the only keratin stain that is consistently positive in PMH, whereas other commonly used keratin markers have weak and diffuse reactivity [7]. FLI-1, the nuclear transcription factor that has an association with cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis, stains the endothelial component of PMH [13]. PMH can also stain variably positive for CD31, CAM5.2, smooth muscle actin, and epithelial membrane antigen [7]. INI-1 positivity is the main differentiating factor between PMH and conventional epithelioid sarcoma. INI-1 expression is lost in 90% of epithelioid sarcomas, but retained in PMH [9, 14]. Beyond the INI-1 comparison, epithelioid sarcoma is positive for EMA and CD34, while PMH has variable positivity for EMA and is negative for CD34. CD34 can also be used to help differentiate PMH from EH and EA, since EH and EA will stain positive for CD34 [10] In addition, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma uniquely stains positive for calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1) due to the WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion gene found over 90% of the time [15]. When comparing scSCC to PMH, both stain positive for keratin markers, however the endothelial markers CD31 and ERG help exclude this diagnosis. Exclusion of carcinoma is critical, given that SCC is much more frequently encountered in this anatomic location. PMH is distinctly negative for desmin, which can be used to distinguish it from tumors of myogenic origin [16, 17]. Molecular studies can also be used to demonstrate a characteristic translocation between chromosomes 7 and 19 that results in a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion gene [3, 4, 18]. This translocation is thought to be the driver mutation of this neoplasm, and is diagnostic for this entity [3, 4].\nTo the best of our knowledge, the current case represents only the second documented case of oral PMH. The previous case was reported by Rawal and involved the anterior maxillary gingiva in a 21-year-old female [7]. This patient was similarly treated with a wide local excision and remained disease free for two-years after definitive surgery. Although it is difficult to ascertain demographic information based on such a limited sample, it is interesting to note that both oral cases opposed the strong male predominance of PMH reported in other locations.\nConclusion\nPMH is a vascular neoplasm of intermediate biologic potential which may rarely involve the oral cavity. Due to its behavior profile, it may mimic more commonly encountered, reactive oral lesions, leading to a delay in diagnosis and management. The current case represents only the second documented report of oral PMH and highlights the salient features of this entity.\nFunding\nThe study received no commercial funding.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest declared by any other author.\nFootnotes\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nReferences\nArticles from Head and Neck Pathology are provided here courtesy of Humana Press\nACTIONS\nPERMALINK\nRESOURCES\n\n\n                            Similar articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                             Cited by other articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                                 Links to NCBI Databases\n                            \n\nCite\nAdd to Collections\n\n                            Connect with NLM\n                        \n\nNational Library of Medicine\n             8600 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20894\n\n",

It is diagnosed using a combination of imaging studies, histopathological examinations, and immunohistochemical staining. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, with the goal of achieving a wide local excision and reducing the risk of recurrence. The role of systemic therapies is not well established because of the rarity of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, uncertainty regarding its response to currently approved medications, and lack of randomized controlled trials. We describe the case of an 18-year-old male patient diagnosed with multifocal pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma of the left lower limb who was treated with everolimus in addition to denosumab, achieving a partial response that was consolidated with resection, radiofrequency ablation, and radiotherapy of multiple local lesions, achieving a long-lasting response. Following subsequent disease progression, the patient responded favorably to pazopanib, with no significant toxicities.\nKeywords: Hemangioendothelioma; Hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid; Neoplasms, vascular tissue; Everolimus; Denosumab; Pazopanib\nINTRODUCTION\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is an ultrarare vascular sarcoma that typically affects young adults.(1–3) Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma most commonly presents as a locally aggressive disease, although its metastatic potential has been previously described.(4,5) Treatment is mostly based on a surgical approach, because the benefits of systemic therapy or radiation are not well defined.(6)\nWe report a case of a patient presenting with multifocal PMH in multiple tissue planes of the left lower extremity treated successfully with surgical excision in addition to everolimus, denosumab, pazopanib, radiofrequency ablation, and radiation therapy.\nCASE REPORT\nIn February 2021, an 18-year-old male patient with no known comorbidities presented with pain in his left leg and knee during walking. He denied any history of trauma, and a physical examination revealed no signs of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left knee revealed focal areas of bone signal alteration in the distal femur and subcutaneous tissue. Initially, these findings were interpreted as nonspecific and likely unrelated to the patient's symptoms. A subsequent MRI performed due to persistent symptoms 2 months later demonstrated a significant increase in the dimensions of most of the focal bone lesions described in the previous study, located in the left femur, left tibia, and left fibula, as well as the appearance of new soft tissue masses in multiple tissue planes. Subsequently, a positron emission tomography (PET-CT) revealed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity in multiple small osteolytic lesions affecting the distal femur, patella, tibia, fibula, talus, and calcaneus, all within the left lower limb. These lesions were predominantly cortical, exhibiting periosteal and endosteal erosion, and were associated with soft tissue lesions in the muscular and subcutaneous planes.\nIn June 2021, excisional biopsies were performed on four samples: nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the left thigh, nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the left leg, left distal fibular lesions, and left calcaneal lesions. All four samples were processed for histopathological analysis (Figure 1) and immunohistochemistry (Table 1) to confirm the diagnosis of PMH.\nFigure 1.

In addition, somatic genetic testing (Foundation Heme) was performed. After two doses of denosumab, the patient developed worsening symptoms and a new palpable soft tissue nodule. A new PET-CT scan showed an increase in the FDG uptake of bone lesions as well as in the number, dimensions, and FDG uptake of focal nodular lesions of the subcutaneous tissue/muscle of the left thigh and leg. At that time, the results of the somatic testing were available and showed no reportable genomic alterations (Table 2).\nTable 2. Somatic panel.\n| Foundation one heme |\n| :-- |\n| MSS, 0 mut/Mb, no reportable genomic alterations have been described |\n| Variant of uncertain significance: TSC1 (K587R), MLH1 (Q689R), JAK1 (V464M), FBX011 (P49_Q50insP), ZNF217 (C697R) |\nOpen in a new tab\nIn August 2021, everolimus (10mg/day) was started in addition to the continuation of denosumab 120 mg/monthly due to the PET-CT findings of disease progression. Denosumab treatment was continued because of the presence of active bone lesions. In October 2022, a dose reduction to 5mg/day was required because of severe mucositis (grade 2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events - CTCAE) refractory to topical symptomatic interventions. In the first everolimus response assessment, PET-CT revealed a partial response (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. PET-CT showing response to everolimus. PET-CT, positron emission tomography-computed tomography.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTherefore, everolimus (5mg/day) combined with denosumab (120mg monthly) was continued. In January 2022, a new PET-CT scan was performed, demonstrating a persistent partial response, although some areas exhibited a slight increase in FDG uptake. No evidence of new lesions was observed. The dose of everolimus was then increased, alternating between 5 and 10mg every other day, and treatment for mucositis was intensified. In April 2022, PET-CT showed that the majority of lesions maintained a partial response, although there were signs of increased glycolytic hypermetabolism in a small focal lesion in the soft tissues of the dorsum of the left midfoot, in the focal lesion in the projection of the soleus muscle of the middle or distal third of the left leg, and in most of the osteolytic lesions in the distal femur, tibia, and fibula on the left.\nIn May 2022, multiple soft tissue tumors of the left thigh, knee, leg, ankle, and foot were surgically resected. In addition, curettage was performed, followed by cementation of the left calcaneal lesion. Intraoperatively, the calcaneal tendon was evaluated, and tumor infiltration was suspected. After an onsite biopsy, the surgeon decided not to remove the entire calcaneal tendon. Moreover, radiofrequency ablation (Medtronics Osteocool™) of multiple lesions of the femur, tibia, fibula, ankle bones, and left foot was required. The pathology report confirmed PMH in all the samples. Most of the lesions had free margins. None of the specimens showed areas of necrosis, although there were occasional areas of fibrosis adjacent to the site of injury. A biopsy of the calcaneal tendon lesion confirmed PMH. Figure 2 shows the pathological findings.\nIn July 2022, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a slight increase in a single lesion located in the myotendinous transition of the calcaneus, which was previously untreated. Subsequently, the patient underwent radiotherapy treatment from 08/29/22 to 09/02/22 at a dose of 2500 cGy (divided into five sessions for the left calcaneal lesion and the same dose for the left fibula head). The patient was closely monitored with imaging examinations every 3 months and remained with no systemic treatment and no evidence of disease progression until May 2023.\nPET-CT performed in May 2023 showed progressive disease with the appearance of new uptake in lytic lesions in the left tarsal cuboid and posterior cortex of the left calcaneus and increased uptake in lytic lesions in the left patella, distal femur, and tibia (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. PET-CT showing progressive disease. PET-CT, positrone emission tomography-computed tomography.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nAt that time, owing to multifocal progression, we decided to pursue systemic therapy. Although the patient responded well to everolimus, mucositis significantly impaired his quality of life during therapy. Therefore, pazopanib treatment was initiated at a standard dose of 800mg/day. Immediately after the initiation of treatment, the patient was admitted to the hospital to treat the erysipelas of the left leg. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed soft tissue infection with no evidence of osteomyelitis.\nThe first PET-CT scan after the start of pazopanib in July 2023 showed a reduction in the uptake of all bone lesions, which was considered a partial response in the femur, tibia, calcaneus, and talus. To date, pazopanib has shown no relevant toxicities. PET-CT performed in October 2023 confirmed an ongoing partial response to pazopanib. Figure 4 shows the timeline of all treatments received by the patient.\nFigure 4. Timeline of diagnostic tests and therapy.\n\nPR: partial response; DP: disease progressive.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe case has been reported in line with the CARE guidelines for case reports.(7)\nThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (CAAE: 77048623.6.0000.0071; #6, 647, 377).\nDISCUSSION\nThe diagnosis and management of ultra-rare sarcomas are challenging for pathologists, orthopedic surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists.(8–10) Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is an ultra-rare indolent vascular tumor initially described as \"pseudomyogenic (fibroma-like) variant of epithelioid sarcoma\" due to the lack of histologic evidence of vascular differentiation.(11) Later, with additional immunohistochemical analyses, clinical recognition, and molecular diagnostics, this entity was better characterized.(12)\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is commonly diagnosed in young adults, with a male predominance of 4–5:1, and a mean age of 30 years.(13) Lower extremities are the most common sites of involvement (54%), as shown in this case report; however, other anatomic primary sites have been described.(1) This clinical entity exhibits locally aggressive behavior in most cases. Moreover, multifocality is present in 66% of the cases, and bone involvement is reported in one-quarter of the patients. Multiple anatomical planes, such as the dermis, subcutis, and skeletal muscle, are involved in >90% of cases with multifocality, as was the case in our patient.(14) The pattern of bone lesions is characterized by cortical and intramedullary lytic lesions with well-defined borders, without signs of local aggressiveness, and a low risk of metastatic disease.(15)\nThe diagnosis is challenging because of the rarity of this condition. In the largest reported series, the duration of symptoms before excision ranged from to 1-24 months (mean, 7 months). In the present case, the time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4 months, which is in line with the literature. Potential differential diagnoses include vascular tumors, such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid angiosarcoma, and non-vascular lesions, such as metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma. Consequently, a comprehensive diagnostic approach consistent with imaging (radiological, magnetic resonance imaging, and PET-CT), in addition to pathological findings, is relevant for a correct diagnosis.(16)\nHistopathologically, the tumor was characterized by epithelioid-to-spindle endothelial cells with dense eosinophilic cytoplasm, few intracytoplasmic lumens, and no apparent vascular differentiation. These components present with mild-to-moderate cytological atypia, low mitotic activity, and admixed neutrophils. Immunophenotype patterns usually show strong positivity for keratin, Fli-1, and ERG, frequently positive for CD31 but negative for CD34; nuclear expression of SMARCB1 (INI-1) is retained.(17) The t(7;19) (q22;q13) translocation has been described in most PMH cases, leading to a fusion between SERPINE1 and FOSB.(18) In addition, other FOSB fusion partners have been described, such as ACTB,(19) WWTR1,(20) CLTC,(21) EGFL7(22) and POTE1.(23,24)\nThe recurrence pattern was mostly localized. Local recurrences and additional nodules in the same anatomic region have been reported in approximately 60% of patients with this diagnosis, usually within the first 2 years after the excision of the primary tumor.(11) The standard treatment for PMH is local excision and/or curettage, although retrospective data have shown a significant percentage of amputations (20.7%).(16) Notably, metastases are rare. In a large series of 50 patients, only one patient developed metastatic disease; however, long-term follow-up data are necessary to assess the frequency of late metastasis.(1)\nEvidence of the efficacy of systemic therapy for PMH is limited. In recent case reports and small case series, chemotherapy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, anti-resorptive bone therapies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been investigated as treatment options, particularly for multifocal or recurrent lesions.(25–29) Table 3 presents a literature review of case reports on the systemic treatment of PMH.\nTable 3.

SERPINE1 encodes a protein within the serine protease inhibitor family, known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). It has been documented that PAI-1 inhibits apoptosis by triggering the Akt pathway. Therefore, mTOR inhibitors are promising therapeutic targets in this setting.(36,37) Ozeki et al. evaluated the efficacy of this agent in the treatment of PMH. A pediatric patient with high mTOR expression in PMH tissue showed a partial response to everolimus.(26) Moreover, Joseph et al.(25) treated a pediatric patient with everolimus and PMH, revealing a tuberous sclerosis 1(TSC1) mutation. TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressors that inhibit Rheb, a small GTPase essential for mTOR activation.(38)\nJoseph et al.(25) reported the only case with an actionable mutation in DNA sequencing with a partial response to targeted treatment. Despite performing next-generation sequencing, we did not find any genomic alterations in our patient's tumor, and only variants of uncertain significance were identified. Therefore, the treatment the patient received was not targeted to any specific mutations but was based on previously reported drugs used for this disease.(38)\nDenosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets RANK ligands and has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, bone metastasis, and giant cell tumors.(39) Otani et al. treated a single case of PMH of the bone with monthly denosumab administration, which resulted in symptomatic relief of ankle pain.(28) Pasricha et al. used a six-weekly basis Denosumab protocol to achieve stable disease and symptomatic relief after 6 months.(29)\nAs our patient showed disease progression with denosumab and significant toxicity with everolimus, the second-line treatment was pazopanib. The efficacy of TKIs has been described in two previous case reports. The first study to use pazopanib was conducted by Alkanash et al. A 35-year-old male with PMH in his right lower limb was treated with first-line pazopanib and achieved a sustained partial response for 6 months after treatment initiation.(32) Van Jzendoorne et al. described the case of a 17-year-old male who had multiple skin lesions on the head and neck, was diagnosed with PMH, and was treated with telatinib, a multi-tyrosine inhibitor. He had a complete response and continued to use the drug for 9 years when the treatment was stopped because of the unavailability of the drug. Four years after having stopped the medication discontinuation, the patient remained in complete response. In addition, this group created a model using normal endothelial cells, the most likely precursors of PMH, expressing the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion. This fusion product can control the expression and enhance PDGFRA and FLT1 levels. In this model, telatinib effectively inhibited the surface receptors FLT1, FLT4, and PDGFRA and disrupted the self-regulated expression of the fusion product. Consequently, telatinib and other TKIs can indirectly affect the expression of SERPINE1-FOSB and may serve as important therapeutic options for individuals with multifocal, unresectable PMH.(33)\nCONCLUSION\nFurther studies are required to determine the optimal dose, duration, and sequence of systemic therapies for pseudomyogenic hemangioendotheliomas. Here, we describe a case of sequential therapy with everolimus, denosumab, and pazopanib. Our report highlights that the use of systemic therapy in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma represents a significant option for the management of this rare and challenging tumor, especially in cases where surgical resection is not feasible or has resulted in local recurrence or metastasis.\nREFERENCES\n\n1.Hornick JL, Fletcher CD.

This article aims to study the clinicopathological features of PHE.\nMethods\nWe collected the clinicopathological features of 10 new PHE, and examined their molecular pathological features by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In addition, we summarized and analyzed the pathological data of 189 reported cases.\nResults\nThe case group consisted of six men and four women aged 12–83 years (median: 41 years). Five instances occurred in the limbs, three in the head and neck, and two in the trunk. Tumor tissues were composed of spindle cells and round or polygonal epithelioid cells, which were either arranged in sheets or interwoven, along with areas of transitional morphology. Scattered or patchy stromal neutrophil infiltration was observed. Tumor cells had abundant cytoplasm, and some contained vacuoles. The nuclei had mild to moderate atypia, with visible nucleoli, and mitosis was rare. PHE tissues diffusely expressed CD31 and ERG, but not CD34, Desmin, SOX-10, HHV8 or S100, while some samples expressed CKpan, FLI-1 and EMA. INI-1 stain is retained. The proliferation index of Ki-67 is 10–35%. Seven samples were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization, six of which had breakages in FosB proto-oncogene (AP-1 transcription factor subunit). Two patients experienced recurrence; however, no metastasis or death occurred.\nConclusions\nPHE is a rare soft tissue vascular tumor, which has biologically borderline malignant potential, local recurrence, little metastasis, and good overall survival and prognosis. Immunomarkers and molecular detection are valuable for diagnosis.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13000-023-01309-9.\nKeywords: Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, Clinicopathological features, Immunohistochemistry, Molecular pathology\nIntroduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a newly identified intermediate soft tissue tumor. Although the name was first proposed by Hornick et al_. [1] in 2011, the disease has been discussed for many years. In 1992, Mirra et al. [2] first reported five tumors that were histologically similar to epithelioid sarcoma (ES) but lacked its typical characteristics, and called them “variants of epithelioid sarcoma.” In 2003, Billings et al. [3] reported seven patients with low-grade vascular tumors similar to ES, and put forward the concept of “Epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma” In 2011, Hornick et al._ [1], in the largest PHE study to date, reported 50 new cases, further expanding our understanding of these tumors; they named the condition “pseudomyogenic vascular endothelial tumors” to emphasize their histological muscle-like characteristics. Although the name remains controversial [4], the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified PHE as an intermediate type of soft tissue vascular tumor in 2013 [5].\nPHE is rare. It generally occurs in the limbs of young men, especially in the distal lower limbs, but can also occur in various other tissues, including the oral cavity [6, 7], chest wall [1, 8, 9], breast [10], esophagus [11] and external genitalia [1, 12, 13]. It can involve multiple tissue planes, including the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, bone, and skeletal muscle. It is often multifocal and rarely metastasizes; however, it is prone to local recurrence. In this study, we report 10 cases of PHE and comprehensively summarize the details of previously reported cases, to improve our understanding of PHE.\nMaterials and methods\nCase data and specimen collection\nTissue specimens and clinical data were collected from 10 patients with PHE, including three cases from the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College (Bengbu, China), three from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital (Shanghai, China), two from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (Hefei, China), one from the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China (Hefei, China), and one from Yijishan Hospital (Wuhu, China). All the published literature in PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) was comprehensively searched, using the keywords “pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma” or “epithelioid sarcomatoid hemangioendothelioma,” and repeated case reports were excluded to obtain a non-redundant dataset of cases. In total, there were 189 cases of PHE reported in 59 studies (Supplementary Table 1).\nPathological examination\nHematoxylin–eosin staining reagent was purchased from Beijing Zhongshan Jinqiao Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Antibodies were purchased from Fuzhou Maixin Biotechnology Development Co., Ltd. (Fuzhou, China) (Table 1). Immunohistochemical staining was performed by EnVision's two-step method. The main immunohistochemical markers were CKpan, CD34, CD31, FLI-1, EMA, INI-1, S100, SOX-10, HHV8, Desmin and Ki-67. Two pathologists re-evaluated the sections.\nTable 1.\nAntibodies used in immunohistochemistry and their sources\n| Antibody | Clone number | Monoclonal/Polyclonal | Positive site |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| CK (pan) | MX005 | monoclonal | cytoplasm |\n| CD34 | QBEnd/10 | monoclonal | cell membrane and cytoplasm |\n| CD31 | JC/70A | monoclonal | cell membrane |\n| FLI-1 | MX045 | monoclonal | nucleus |\n| ERG | MXR004 | monoclonal | nucleus |\n| INI-1 | MRQ-27 | monoclonal | nucleus |\n| S100 | 4C4.9 | monoclonal | cytoplasm/nucleus |\n| SOX-10 | EP268 | monoclonal | nucleus |\n| Desmin | D33 | monoclonal | cytoplasm |\n| Vimentin | V9 | monoclonal | cytoplasm |\n| EMA | E29 | monoclonal | cytoplasm/cell membrane |\n| HHV8 | 13B10 | monoclonal | nucleus |\nOpen in a new tab\nFluorescence in situ hybridization\nFOSB (19q13) gene fragment probe reagent, in situ hybridization blue staining solution and related reagents required for in situ hybridization experiment were purchased from Ambiping Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). According to the instructions, 7 PHE cases were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.\nData collection and analysis\nPositive immunohistochemical signals for FLI-1, INI-1, HHV8 and Ki-67 were located in the nucleus, while those for CKpan,and Desmin were observed in the cytoplasm. CD31 was observed in the cell membrane, and CD34 was observed in the cell membrane or cytoplasm. S100 and ERG signals were observed in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining results were scored according to their intensity and range (the percentage of total cancer cells that were stained). The scoring for staining intensity was as follows: colorless, 0 points; pale yellow, 1 point; light brown, 2 points; dark brown, 3 points. The staining range was scored as follows: < 5%, 0 points; 5–25%, 1 point; 26–50%, 2 points; 51–75%, 3 points; > 75%, 4 points. The two scores were then multiplied, and samples scoring 0 points were considered negative; 1–4 points, weakly positive; 5–8 points, moderately positive; 9–12 points, strongly positive. Fluorescence in situ hybridization signals in cancer cell nuclei were observed and quantified under a high-power microscope. A red signal indicated > 10% separation between the number of red and green signals in 50 cells, meaning that the FosB proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (FOSB) gene, was broken and rearranged; with < 10% separation, samples were considered negative.\nPatient follow-up\nThe patients were followed up for 2–55 months through outpatient services and telephone calls. Follow-up data on the 189 previously reported cases were summarized.\nResults\nClinical data\nThe patients included six males and four females, aged 12–83 years, with a median age of 41 years (Table 2). Three cases had the tumor in the lower limbs, three in the head and neck, two in the upper limbs, and two in the trunk. The masses of seven patients were painless, while three patients were treated for painful nodules. Multiple tumors were observed in 5/10 cases. Approximately 25% of PHE cases have bone involvement [1], and among the 10 patients in this group, one was treated for bone tumors in the left knee and one for bone tumors in the left foot. Among the 189 PHE cases screened, 139 were male and 50 were female. Their ages were widely distributed, ranging from 6 to 86 years, with an average age of 34 years. The disease occurred in the limbs, trunk, head, and face, but was concentrated in the limbs (140 cases, 74%), especially in the legs (112 cases, 59%). It was also occasionally detected in the oral cavity, vulva, and breast and often showed multifocal involvement (134 cases, 71%).\nTable 2.\nClinical data from 10 patients\n| Patient number | Sex | Age | Site | Single/\nmultiple\nnodules | Recurrence/\nmetastasis | Treatment | Follow-up (months) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 1 | Female | 51 | neck | Mul | Recurrence | E | 3 |\n| 2 | Male | 21 | forearm | Sin | No | E | 2 |\n| 3 | Female | 22 | foot | Mul | Recurrence | E | 55 |\n| 4 | Female | 83 | Face | Sin | No | E | 13 |\n| 5 | Male | 12 | femur | Mul | Recurrence | E | 18 |\n| 6 | Male | 22 | back | Mul | Recurrence | E + C | 31 |\n| 7 | Male | 32 | arm | Mul | No | E | 12 |\n| 8 | Female | 63 | knee | Sin | No | E | 51 |\n| 9 | Male | 73 | neck | Sin | No | E | 22 |\n| 10 | Male | 70 | neck | Sin | No | E | 18 |\nOpen in a new tab\nAbbreviations__: E Excision, C Chemotherapy, Mul Multiple, Sin Single\nHistopathology and immunohistochemistry\nMacroscopically, the 10 new tumors were 0.7–6.5 cm in diameter and were gray-white or gray-red nodules with unclear boundaries and infiltration. Some tissues were compressed and damaged to some extent. The tumors involved the dermis, subcutaneous tissues, and bones. Microscopically, various proportions of spindle cells and epithelioid cells were observed in the lesions. The spindle cells were arranged in loose strips, bundles, or nodules, and the cells were rich and plump, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and an oval nucleus. Epithelial cells were either round or pleomorphic, and some contained cytoplasmic vacuoles. In some areas, spindle cells and epithelioid endothelial cells could migrate (Fig. 1). Scattered infiltrating inflammatory cells were observed in the stroma, and mitosis was rare, without tumor necrosis or pathological mitosis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that cells in the 10 tumors were diffusely positive for CD31 and ERG but negative for CD34, Desmin, and S100. Some cases were positive for FLI-1, CD56, and CKpan but negative for SMA, S100, HHV8 and SOX-10. INI-1 stain is retained. The proliferation index of Ki-67 is 10–35% (Fig. 2).\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nHistological characteristics of PHE tumors. A The tumor cells grow in nodules (× 40). B The tumor cells migrate with the surrounding spindle muscle epithelial cells. The tumor cells are epithelioid or fat spindle-shaped, with abundant acidophilous cytoplasm (× 100). C Epithelioid tumor cells are rich in eosinophilic cytoplasm, slightly heteromorphic in nucleus, with nucleolus, and mitosis in focal areas (× 400). D The tumor cells grow around the blood vessels. Neutrophils, plasma cells and eosinophils can be seen in the stroma (× 400)\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nImmunohistochemical characteristics of PHE tumor cells.

(Fig. 2A, D-F × 400; Fig. 2B-C × 200)\nMolecular genetics\nSeven cases of PHE were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect disruptions in FOSB (19q13). Six cases were positive for FOSB breakage (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nFluorescent in situ hybridization to test FOSB breakage. Red dots: centromeres; green dots: telomeres. Red arrows indicate separation signals\nPrognosis\nDuring 2–55 months of follow-up, four cases recurred after surgery; however, no metastasis or death occurred. Among the 175 previous cases with clinical data, 16 (9%) experienced metastasis, 41 (23%) had recurrences, and 4 died, including 2 from distant metastases, one from squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis at the base of the mouth, and one from an unknown cause. The remaining cases were cured either after initial treatment or after one or more recurrences.\nDiscussion\nPHE is a rare, low-grade, malignant, soft tissue tumor, officially named by the WHO in 2013, and is classified as a vascular tumor subtype [5]. Currently, less than 200 cases have been reported in the literature, primarily in case reports. PHE is common in the distal extremities of young men, especially in the lower limbs, and is often multifocal and involves multiple tissue planes. Some patients suffer from pain, and while the tumors rarely metastasize, they easily recur locally, requiring close clinical follow-up.\nMacroscopically, PHE has unclear boundaries and appears as gray-white or gray-red nodules in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, with diameters ranging from several millimeters to several centimeters. Microscopically, the centers of PHE lesions are composed of plump fusiform cells and round epithelioid cells loosely arranged in sheets or bundles. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic, similar to rhabdomyoblasts. Infiltration of neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells can usually be observed in stroma. During early pathological changes, slight cell atypia is often observed; the nucleoli are small and not obvious, and mitosis is rare. In recurrent lesions, cell atypia is more obvious, with different nuclear sizes, prominent nucleoli, chromatin aggregation, and pathological mitosis [2]. Tumors often infiltrate surrounding soft tissues, such as the adipose tissue and muscle tissue. Among the 189 PHE cases reported in the past, tumors were reported in the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and bones. Of the 50 PHE cases reported by Hornick et al_. [1], 32 involved multiple tissue planes and the tumor edges showed infiltration. Most tumor cells were spindle cells, with a few epithelioid cells, and most tumors showed mild atypia. Billings et al._ [3] observed intracytoplasmic vacuoles in four of seven PHE cases. Our 10 cases also involved the subcutaneous and bone tissue planes. Morphologically, fat spindle cells and rounded epithelial cells were observed, with no obvious cell atypia. Some tumor cells had a big cytoplasm and were eosinophilic, similar to rhabdomyoblasts; however, no vascular differentiation was observed. Because there is little or no obvious evidence of vascular differentiation in PHE histology, it is very difficult to diagnose the disease in this manner, and immunohistochemistry is crucial. PHE usually strongly expresses CKpan, while CD31 and ERG are expressed to different degrees. CD31, with membrane positivity and linear staining, is a characteristic immunohistochemical marker of PHE. CD34, Desmin, and S100 are not expressed, while FLI-1 is partially expressed, INI-1stain is always retained [3]. In our 10 PHE cases, CD31 and ERG were diffusely expressed, but CD34, Desmin, HHV8 and S100 were not, and some cases expressed CKpan and FLI-1, INI-1 stain is retained.\nThree fusion genes have been detected in PHE: actin-beta (ACTB)-FOSB, WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1)-FOSB, and serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1)-FOSB. Among these, ACTB-FOSB and SERPINE1-FOSB are the characteristic genetic manifestations of PHE, as they are frequently detected, playing important roles in diagnosis [14]. In this group, seven patients with PHE were tested for FOSB cleavage and six were positive. One sample was negative; however, this may have been due to insufficient amounts of tissue for analysis.\nSoft tissue tumors are widely distributed; there are many types, but all have similar structures and cell morphologies. Proper differential diagnosis is important for their treatment and therefore has clinical significance. Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a malignant mesenchymal tumor with an epithelioid morphology and phenotype. Apart from obvious central necrosis and more atypia, ES is very similar to PHE in clinical and histological features, and immunohistochemistry has become an important means of distinguishing between the two conditions. ES simultaneously expresses epithelial markers, such as EMA and CKpan, but does not express CD31 and FLI-1 [15]. In recent years, a lack of INI-1 expression has been identified as a specific marker for ES [16, 17], making the combined detection of INI-1, CD31, and FLI-1 helpful in distinguishing ES and PHE. Epithelial hemangioendothelioma (EH) is a central malignant vascular tumor. Unlike PHE, EH is more common in women and comprises epithelial-like endothelial cells arranged in bundles, with obvious cytoplasmic vacuolation and a stroma filled with transparent mucus. Classical EH expresses ERG, CD31, CD34, and FLI-1, while PHE usually does not express CD34. In recent years, the t(1;3)(q36;q25) chromosomal translocation, which combines the calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 gene and WWTR1, has become regarded as a characteristic genetic manifestation of EH. Being a malignant tumor, the metastasis rate of EH is as high as 20–30%, and the prognosis is worse than that of PHE. Epithelioid angiosarcoma (EA) is a highly malignant tumor with obvious malignant tumor cell characteristics, such as poor differentiation, obvious atypia, and frequent mitosis. It is prone to local recurrence and metastasis in a short time. Compared to PHE, the tumor cell atypia of EA is more obvious, the nuclear division is more common, and tumor tissue often bleed and die. In most cases, anastomotic vascular cavities can be seen. Regarding immunohistochemistry, unlike in PHE, CD31 and FLI-1 are usually negative in EA, while CD34 is partially positive.\nPHE is a type of vascular tumor that easily recurs locally but rarely metastasizes. Most patients with PHE to date have only required tumor resection, while a few underwent extensive resection or even amputation, along with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. All 10 of our cases were resected, and two also received chemotherapy. Among 173 PHE patients with clinical data, 138 (80%) underwent surgical resection and 15 (8.67%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressants. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the use of mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) inhibitors in PHE treatment [18–21]. mTOR activity is inhibited by rapamycin, which exerts antitumor effects by inhibiting proliferation and cell cycle progression. For patients with PHE who experience either adverse effects after radiotherapy and chemotherapy or metastasis, clinical symptoms improve after treatment with mTOR inhibitors. David et al_. [22] studied the effect of the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion protein on endothelial cell function and its interaction with telatinib and suggested that telatinib may be a highly specific targeted treatment option for patients with PHE who are ineligible for surgery. Davis et al._ [23] described a multifocal case of PHE involving both bone and soft tissues and proposed a treatment strategy using radiofrequency ablation and extensive resection for the bone and soft tissue lesions, respectively. These new therapeutic strategies provide new PHE treatment options; however, they are all case reports and will require verification with more cases.\nIn conclusion, PHE is a rare intermediate soft-tissue tumor with inert biological behavior, which often recurs but only occasionally metastasizes. Because of its lack of specific morphological features, it is easily misdiagnosed based solely on histomorphology. However, PHE exhibits characteristic immunohistochemical markers and molecular changes, which play extremely important roles in its diagnosis. To date, less than 200 cases of PHE have been reported worldwide. As more cases are reported in the future, our understanding of PHE will deepen.\nSupplementary Information\n13000_2023_1309_MOESM1_ESM.docx (34.7KB, docx)Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 1.

We present a 35-year-old male with an unremarkable medical history, who was referred to a sarcoma clinic complaining of right heel pain with equinus deformity and a mass in his right lower limb for 6 months. Biopsy was performed and reported as Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma. The patient was started on pazopanib with a favorable clinical and radiological response. Long-term follow-up is still needed, however further studies are vital to clarify the role of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor therapy.\nKeywords: sarcoma, tki, epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, pseudomyogenic hamangioendothelioma, pazopanib\nIntroduction\nSoft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a heterogeneous group of tumors with over one hundred histologic subtypes that requires a pathologist specialized in sarcoma for diagnosis [1]. Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE), also known as epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma (ES-H), was first described in 2013 by WHO. It is a vascular tumor biologically behaving like benign hemangioma and malignant angiosarcoma and rarely metastasizes [2,3]. In the fifth edition of WHO classifications of bone and soft tissue tumors published in 2020, PHE was further characterized by a balanced t(7;19) translocation causing a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion [4].\nPHE predominantly affects young adults at age of 20-40 years with a male to female ratio of 4.6:1 with muscle (34%) being the most commonly affected tissue followed by dermis (31%), subcutaneous tissue (20%), and bone (14%). Most commonly, it affects the lower extremity in deep soft tissues accounting for 60% of the cases found in the literature [5,6]. Studies on PHE management are still lacking, particularly in patient subgroups [7]. In the present case report, we report the clinical activity of pazopanib in a Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma patient.\nCase presentation\nWe present a 35-year-old male with an unremarkable medical history who was referred to a sarcoma clinic complaining of right heel pain with equinus deformity and a mass in his right lower limb for 6 months. He underwent an excisional biopsy in a community hospital that came suspicious for neoplasia and inconclusive. On examination, his right foot showed equinus deformity along with multiple skin nodules in the tibia. The neurovascular exam was unremarkable.\nInitial diagnostic MRI revealed nonspecific multiple subcutaneous and muscular enhancing nodules associated with osteopenia involving the right tibia and foot. PET CT done in September 2021 showed FDG-avidity in the deep subcutaneous/intramuscular foci involving the right lower limb. No suspicious FDG-avid lesions were seen elsewhere (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. FDG PET-CT whole body.\n\nFDG-avidity in the deep subcutaneous/intramuscular foci involving the right lower limb\nBiopsy was repeated at our center and reported as Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma. Immunohistochemistry panel revealed: SMA (-), DESMIN (-), S100 (-), CD34 (-), AE1/AE3 (+), CD31 (+); IHC staining for FOSB was not available in our laboratory.\nThe case was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumor board and the consensus was to go for systemic therapy. The patient was started on pazopanib 800 mg daily on October first. Subsequently, it was decreased to 600 mg due to GI intolerance with good clinical response in terms of decreased pain. Patient had imaging re-evaluation with leg MRI done in December 2021 that demonstrated a mild interval decrease in the size of the previously described multiple scattered subcutaneous and intramuscular enhancing nodules of the right leg and foot with the largest lesion in the posterolateral aspect of the lateral head gastrocnemius muscle currently measuring 0.5 x 1 x 1.7 cm (previously was 1.1 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm) in maximum AP, transverse and craniocaudal dimensions, respectively (Figure 2). No new soft tissue lesion is seen. \nFigure 2. MRI right lower limb pre/post pazopanib .\n\nA&B MRI right lower limb post pazopanib\nC&D MRI right lower limb pre pazopanib  \nAnother dose reduction in pazopanib was required to 400 mg due to significant fatigue and anorexia. He was also noted to develop generalized skin and hair hypopigmentation. In March 2022, MRI to assess response was done again showing disease stability.\nDiscussion\nThere are few reports on PHE. In 2017, Pradhan et al. have reported 8 patients with males representing 7 out of 8 patients (87.5%) and a mean age at presentation of 29 years. In this case series, the mean tumor size was 1.9cm ranging between 0.3 and 5.5 cm. The most common site of involvement was the leg in 6 patients (75%) with the remaining two cases occurring on the arm [8]. Half of the cases involved the bone, while the other half were restricted to the superficial and deep soft tissue (25% and 25% respectively). At presentation, a total of five cases (62.5%) showed multifocal disease. The second case series reported in 2011 by Hornick and Fletcher describe fifty patients with a male predominance (82%) and mean age of 31 years at diagnosis [6]. In more than half of the cases (54%), the primary site was in the leg, followed by 24% on the arm, 18% on the trunk, and 4% on the neck. Tumor involved the dermis and subcutaneous tissue in 52%, followed by skeletal muscle 34%, and bone 14%. Again, 66% showed multifocal disease at presentation. Our patient sex, age, and tumor characteristics were consistent with previously published data.\nSince Pseudomyogenic (epithelioid sarcoma-like) Hemangioendothelioma (PHE) was introduced as a new distinguished entity of vascular endothelial neoplasm in 2013, no standard of care or treatment was established for such cases. The literature reports various treatment options such as local control (surgical resection, and cryotherapy) and systemic therapy (chemotherapy, Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI), bone resorptive agent, and Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor like bevacizumab) [9].\nIn a report of 58 clinical cases of PHE with bone and soft tissue involvement, 69% underwent local treatment with excision or curettage, whereas 20.7% had amputations. Seven patients were treated with mTOR inhibitors and 4 patients with anti-resorptive treatments in those with multifocal lesions not amenable to local treatment [10]. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and mTOR have showed clinical and radiological benefit [11]. Gemcitabine + docetaxel regimen was used in one patient with favorable response. However, it did not yield tumor shrinkage in another patient [11]. DNA sequencing of one patient revealed a pathogenic mutation of the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1); everolimus was administered for this patient resulting in mild shrinkage of PHE metastases [11].\nTelatinib was the first investigational TKI tried in PHE In 2018 [12]. In that study, the patient with extensive PHE was given telatinib, and showed a durable complete remission. The in vitro model for PHE showed that telatinib affected the self-regulated expression of the fusion gene throughout VEGF- and PDGF-receptor signaling and regulating SERPINE1 [12]. Our patient has received pazopanib which is a multi-target TKI and demonstrated clinical benefit with disease regression that is durable with 6 months of follow-up. Similar to Telatinib, Pazopanib is a promising treatment option for PHE that warrants further study in the future. Pazopanib is showing promise in this rare disease and its role should be explored further in this tumor type.\nConclusions\nWith the inadequate knowledge of the pathogenetic mechanisms and the lack of randomized controlled trials, treatment of PHE remains unclear, and its indolent behavior makes extensive surgery with amputation more aggressive than needed. However, further studies with more patients are required to clarify the role of pazopanib in PHE.\nThe content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

Clinical recognition of RH is troublesome because of its non-specific appearance, with differential diagnosis comprising a variety of benign and malignant tumors clinically presenting as reddish nodules. In this article we describe the clinical, dermoscopic and histopathologic findings in a case of RH developing on the flank of a 26-year-old woman, and discuss the possible role of dermoscopy in facilitating the clinical recognition of this rare tumor.\nKeywords: retiform hemangioendothelioma, hemangioendothelioma, dermoscopy, vascular tumors\nIntroduction\nHemangioendothelioma is a term encompassing neoplasms with an intermediate biological behavior between benign hemangiomas and angiosarcomas. It affects the skin and the soft tissues and includes retiform hemangioendothelioma (RH), papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA, Dabska’s tumor), epithelioid, kaposiform, pseudomyogenic, and composite hemangioendotheliomas [1].\nRH is an infrequently encountered vascular neoplasm of borderline malignancy that was originally classified as a distinct type of low-grade cutaneous angiosarcoma (CA) in 1994 by Calonje et al [2]. Histopathologically, the vascular channels of RH resemble the rete testis (retiform), while the term “hemangioendothelioma” reflects its putative borderline malignancy, as opposed to the benign angioma and the malignant angiosarcoma.\nMorphologically, RH typically develops as a solitary, gradually enlarging exophytic mass, nodule or plaque, most often on the lower limbs, upper limbs and trunk. The tumor shows a predilection for young to middle-aged adults (mean age 36 years) and females (2:1) [2]. Duration of the disease and tumor size at the time of diagnosis have been reported to range from 2 months to several years and from 1 to 30 cm, respectively [2]. A case of RH presenting with multiple lesions on the limbs and trunk has also been described [3].\nSurgical excision is the treatment of choice for RH [1–4]. However, accurately defining the excision margins in a vascular neoplasm with a dissecting growth pattern is particularly troublesome. Indeed, the tumor is associated with a high rate of local recurrence (50%), which may occur from months to several years after surgery [2,3]. Regional lymph node metastasis was reported in a single patient, while no distant metastases have been reported to date [4].\nCase report\nA 26-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of an asymptomatic, enlarging tumor of the right flank. The patient’s previous medical history was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed a well-defined, infiltrated red nodule, measuring a diameter of 3 cm (Figure 1). No regional lymphadenopathy was detected. Dermoscopic examination revealed a pinkish background color and few dotted and linear vessels (Figure 2).\nFigure 1.\n\nAn asymptomatic, rapidly enlarging, infiltrated, red nodule. [Copyright: ©2013 Mota et al.]\nFigure 2.\n\nDermoscopically, the tumor exhibited a pinkish background colour and few dotted and linear vessels. [Copyright: ©2013 Mota et al.]\nHistopathologic examination (Figures 3 and 4) following punch biopsy revealed that the tumor was dermal based and ill defined. It was characterized by an infiltrative growth pattern, involving the entire dermis but sparing the subcutis, and consisted of long and thin arborizing vessels dissecting the dermal collagen. The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with frequent hobnail features and papillary projections. Rare solid endothelial areas were present in the superficial part of the lesion. No cytological atypia nor mitotic activity were noted. Extravasation of erythrocytes, hemosiderin deposition and inflammatory infiltrate were absent. On immunohistochemistry, the lesion reacted diffusely with CD31 and focally with D2–40. The monoclonal antibody against the latent nuclear antigen-1 of HHV8 was negative.\nFigure 3.\n\n(A) At low magnification, the neoplasm was ill defined and involved the entire dermis (H&E ×20). (B) A higher magnification revealed that it consisted of long arborizing vessels, dissecting the dermal collagen (H&E ×100). (C) The vessels were lined by plump endothelial cells with frequent papillary projections (H&E ×200). [Copyright: ©2013 Mota et al.]\nFigure 4.\n\n(A) Few solid areas were present in the upper dermis (H&E ×100). (B) In the lower dermis, the neoplastic proliferation showed an infiltrative growth pattern among the collagen bundles (H&E ×100). (C) The diffuse immunohistochemical positivity with CD31 confirmed the endothelial origin of the neoplastic proliferation, (D) while antibody D2–40 stained only rare lymphatic vessels. [Copyright: ©2013 Mota et al.]\nBased on the aforementioned histopathologic findings, the diagnosis of RH was established and the tumor was subsequently excised. On histopathology, some residual dissecting vessels were present besides the dermal scar.\nDiscussion\nClinical recognition of RH is troublesome because of its non-specific appearance, with differential diagnosis comprising a variety of benign and malignant tumors clinically presenting as reddish nodules. RH has to be differentiated from other hemangioendotheliomas, CA, hemangioma, targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma, blue-rubber bleb nevus syndrome, Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), lymphoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, amelanotic melanoma (AM) and cutaneous metastases [2,3].\nAlthough the diagnosis of RH is based on histopathologic examination, discrimination from other vascular tumors might be challenging even histopathologically. The presence of infiltrative vascular spaces allows ruling out benign proliferations as hobnail hemangioma, which typically is more superficial and well defined. Differentiation from Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is based mainly on the different clinical setting, the typical cellular spindling and the HHV8 immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells that characterize KS. CA is characterized by cellular pleomorphism and prominent mitotic activity, features that allow discrimination from RH. Distinguishing between RH and PILA is highly challenging, since they both affect young patients, are characterized by a predilection for the limbs, and share similar histopathologic characteristics [5–7]. The architecture of the vessels, which are thin and arborizing in RH and often dilated in PILA, and the immunohistochemical reactivity of the latter to markers of lymphatic differentiation like D2–40 and VEGFR-3 represent clues for differentiating between the two entities [7].\nIn our case, D2-40 antibody reacted only in normal vascular endothelium, representing the internal control, and failed to demonstrate a convincing lymphatic differentiation, findings suggestive of the diagnosis of RH [8,9].\nGiven that the choice treatment of RH is surgical excision to tumor-free margins, the most relevant differential diagnostic problem in clinical terms, is to discriminate RH from benign vascular tumors, whose management is essentially conservative.\nDermoscopy has been shown to improve the clinical evaluation of pigmented and non-pigmented skin tumors, enabling the visualization of morphologic structures that might be critical for the differential diagnosis [10].\nIn our case, dermoscopy revealed a pinkish color, which is also known to characterize AM, KS and CA and, effectively, cannot be considered as predictive of a specific diagnosis [10,11]. However, since it has been only described in the context of malignant tumors, the detection of pinkish (milky red) color enhanced us to avoid misinterpretation of the tumor as benign and prompted us to perform a biopsy.\nIn conclusion, although the dermoscopic criteria of RH and other endotheliomas require further investigation, our case highlights that dermoscopy should always be performed when clinically evaluating skin tumors, since the additional morphologic information provided might facilitate the appropriate clinical decision. Undoubtedly, dermoscopic findings should always be integrated with clinical information, such as patient’s age and history. Furthermore, the current case further supports the previously reported observation that detection of pinkish color on dermoscopy of nodular lesions is suggestive of malignancy and should warrant excision. Finally, RH should be added in the differential diagnostic spectrum when evaluating a red nodule exhibiting a pinkish color under dermoscopy.\nFootnotes\nFunding: This study was supported, in part, by the Italian Ministry of Health (RF-2010-2316524.\nCompeting interests: The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\nReferences\nArticles from Dermatology Practical & Conceptual are provided here courtesy of Mattioli 1885\nACTIONS\nPERMALINK\nRESOURCES\n\n\n                            Similar articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                             Cited by other articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                                 Links to NCBI Databases\n                            \n\nCite\nAdd to Collections\n\n                            Connect with NLM\n                        \n\nNational Library of Medicine\n             8600 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20894\n\n",

They are typically treated with sclerotherapy, laser therapy, or surgery for localized lesions. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, is a relatively new medical therapy for the treatment of vascular malformations. This case report presents the improvements and complications seen in a female infant who was diagnosed with a large lymphatic malformation on prenatal ultrasound and has been treated with sirolimus during the first 9 months of life.\n1. Introduction\nLymphatic malformations (LMs) are slow-flow cystic anomalies that develop from abnormal embryologic formation of the developing lymphatic system, which enlarge by expansion of the lesion in contrast to proliferation which occurs in vascular tumors. LMs present most frequently in the head and neck and are usually present at birth or by two years of age. Upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may be a causal factor in the development of these abnormal lymphatic vessels. Sirolimus, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to decrease cell proliferation and lymphangiogenesis, is a relatively new medical therapy for vascular malformations [1, 2].\n2. Case Presentation\nA prenatal ultrasound revealed a large LM. The mother went into preterm labor at 31 weeks and 6 days gestational age and delivered via c-section in association with planned exit procedure to stabilize the airway. MRI of the neck on day of life (DOL) 3 showed a very large multiloculated and multispatial mass (Figure 1) within the left neck extending from the left inferior periauricular region through the upper chest with extension across the midline (de Serres stage V). The lesion demonstrated hemorrhage fluid levels and associated mass effect most compatible with a large mixed-cystic LM with recent hemorrhage and complete collapse of the visualized left lung. It measured approximately 8.1 × 5.7 × 5.5 cm. She underwent ultrasound-guided drain placement DOL 10 and sclerotherapy with doxycycline on DOL 11. The drain was then removed on DOL 16. She underwent tracheostomy on DOL 17 and required respiratory support for a total of 56 days before weaning to the trach collar (Figure 2(a)). The patient was started on sirolimus therapy at a dose of 0.8 mg/m2 on DOL 22. Sirolimus therapy has since been maintained at a target serum trough level of 10 to 15 ng/mL. She was initially fed through an orogastric tube, followed by a nasogastric tube, and then through a gastrostomy tube once placed on DOL 52. The patient developed peripheral edema and hypertension thought to be due to sirolimus and which were treated with chlorothiazide beginning on DOL 37. She developed cellulitis of the LM on DOL 26 and again at 5 months of age, treated each time with IV antibiotics. Since discharge from the hospital, the patient has been followed in the otolaryngology clinic at 3-month intervals. The patient has now been on sirolimus treatment for 8 months with reduction in the bulk of the LM. Her functional improvement includes now being able to close her mouth around her tongue (Figure 2(b)).\nFigure 1.\n\nT1+ contrast coronal MRI demonstrates a large mixed-cystic LM extending from the left neck into the chest with recent hemorrhage, measuring 8.1 × 5.7 × 5.5 cm.\nFigure 2.\n\nPrior to sirolimus treatment, there is significant mass effect involving the tongue, floor of mouth, and neck. After eight months of sirolimus treatment, the patient is able to close her mouth around her tongue and has markedly decreased mass effect on the face, mouth, and neck.\n3. Discussion\nTreatment of LMs has typically been managed with sclerotherapy, laser therapy, or surgery for localized lesions. Diffuse malformations present significant challenges due to the morbidity of interventional treatments to achieve local control. There are currently no guidelines for treatment of LMs [3]. mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, have recently been used for their antilymphangiogenic properties in treating LMs [4]. A recent phase II trial showed that sirolimus is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with complicated vascular anomalies [1].\nThis case presents the clinical improvements in an infant female over the first 9 months of life who has been treated with sirolimus beginning in the first month of life following drainage and doxycycline sclerotherapy for a large LM of the left neck and chest.\nAs an immunosuppressant, sirolimus can cause neutropenia and may predispose the patient to an increased risk of infection. Furthermore, lymphatic malformations are known to become infected and hemorrhage. It has been reported, however, that hemorrhage and infections in LMs may be less frequent and milder after treatment with sirolimus [1]. Additionally, sirolimus may be more effective in the treatment of LMs in younger patients [4]. In the present case, treatment with sirolimus has been effective and well tolerated in the neonatal and infant periods. This case highlights the successful medical management of a large, complex LM, while avoiding the morbidity of surgery. Medical therapies that target other elements in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway are currently being studied, including PI3K inhibitors, and they may be promising treatments in the future.\nThis report was reviewed and determined to be exempt by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Jayme Dowdall, MD, for her critical review of the manuscript.

Four patients were treated for autoimmune cytopenias; all had a rapid complete or near complete response. Two patients were treated for autoimmune arthritis and colitis, demonstrating marked improvement. Three patients had complete resolution of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and all patients had a reduction in double negative T cells, a population hallmark of the disease. Based on these significant responses, we recommend that sirolimus be considered as second-line therapy for patients with steroid-refractory disease.\nKeywords: mTOR, autoimmunity, signal transduction, rapamycin\nAutoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a disorder of disrupted lymphocyte homeostasis caused by defective Fas-mediated apoptosis. As part of the down-regulation of the immune response, activated B lymphocytes normally up-regulate Fas expression and activated B and T lymphocytes up-regulate expression of Fas-ligand (Nagata & Golstein, 1995). The binding of Fas to Fas-ligand triggers the caspase cascade, leading to cellular apoptosis. Patients with ALPS have a defect in this extrinsic apoptotic pathway, leading to chronic lymphoproliferation, autoimmune manifestations and a propensity to develop secondary malignancies (Bleesing et al, 2000).\nCurrently, a patient must meet three diagnostic criteria for ALPS: (i) clinically identifiable chronic non-malignant lymphoproliferation; (ii) an increased number of double-negative T cells (DNTs; cell phenotype CD4−/CD8−, CD3+, TCRαβ+) and (iii) in vitro evidence of defective Fas-mediated apoptosis (Bleesing et al, 2000). Supporting evidence for the diagnosis includes genetic mutations in the Fas pathway (FAS, FAS LG, CASP8, or CASP10), systemic autoimmunity, elevated serum levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), elevated serum vitamin B12 and hypergammaglobulinaemia; however, these latter findings are not diagnostic (Rieux-Laucat et al, 2003).\nMost patients with ALPS develop autoimmunity, usually manifested as autoimmune cytopenias. Other autoimmune manifestations are seen less frequently, including autoimmune nephritis, hepatitis, arthritis, colitis, uveitis and urticaria (Sneller et al, 1997). Some patients with ALPS require no treatment; however, many other patients require medications directed toward autoimmune manifestations, particularly autoimmune cytopenias. Patients usually respond to short bursts of immunosuppressive medications, including corticosteroids (Bleesing et al, 2000). Occasionally patients with severe cytopenias need more aggressive immunosuppression. Anecdotal reports and small series have described responses to a number of medications, including cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), vincristine and rituximab (Ferrer et al, 2007). Nevertheless, these agents are often ineffective, have significant side effects and are non-specific for ALPS.\nSirolimus (rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and has been shown to induce apoptosis in both normal and abnormal lymphocytes. We hypothesized that targeting the mTOR pathway might be effective in patients with ALPS by inducing apoptosis in the abnormal lymphocytes underlying this condition. We previously tested this hypothesis using two murine models of ALPS (CBA-lprcg and MRL-lpr) and found sirolimus was more effective than conventional therapies, including MMF (Teachey et al, 2006). Based on these results, we began treating children with refractory ALPS with sirolimus, targeting a serum trough level of 4–15 ng/ml. We have treated six patients and found marked improvement in autoimmune disease markers in all of these patients.\nResults\nPatients with ALPS were followed under an Institutional Review Board-approved classification protocol that allowed data collection, including medication response. We treated six male ALPS patients with sirolimus. Patients were started on sirolimus at 2–3 mg/m2/d, rounding to the nearest 0·5 mg with maximum initial dose of 4 mg. Doses were adjusted to achieve a steady-state serum trough of 4–15 ng/ml. Three of these patients were type Ia because they have a documented mutation in FAS. The other three were classified as type III because no genetic mutation was found. Four corticosteroid-refractory or intolerant patients were treated for severe chronic autoimmune cytopenias. Three of the four patients had complete resolution of autoimmune cytopenias (Table I and Fig 1). The fourth patient had near complete resolution with a residual mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count >100 × 109/l). All four patients were able to completely taper off steroids within 4 weeks of initiating sirolimus. These patients have been treated for 5, 7, 17 and 27 months. Many of these patients had failed other immunosuppressive medications, including MMF (Table I). Two of the six patients were treated with sirolimus for autoimmune arthritis and colitis for 6 and 36 months respectively. Both of these patients had marked improvement in their symptoms on sirolimus after failing multiple other immunosuppressant medications. One of these patients remains on low dose every other day steroids (Patient 5) without toxicity. Prior to sirolimus he required high dose steroids (1–2 mg/kg/d) with significant side effects. The other patient (Patient 6) required re-initiation of steroids after one year and other more aggressive immunosuppressive regimens were tried, including systemic chemotherapy (mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate) and biological agents (anakindra, etanercept, rituximab and MMF) with and without sirolimus. No regimen controlled his disease as well as a combination of sirolimus and steroids and whenever his sirolimus was held for alternative regimens his disease would flare significantly. Thus, he has been continued on chronic sirolimus.\nTable I.\nPatient characteristics and sirolimus response.\nLPD, lymphoproliferative disease; AID, autoimmune disease; LAD, lymphadenopathy; AIN, autoimmune neutropenia; ITP, immune thrombocytopenic purpura; BOOP, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia; IVIG, intravenous immune globulin; MMF, mycophenolate mofetil; CSA, cyclosporine A; CR, complete response.\nPatient 1 had single residual lymph node measuring 0·5 cm.\nPatient 3 also had recurrent oral Herpes simplex virus flares and Epstein–Barr virus reactivation that resolved with initiation of sirolimus.\nSirolimus can cause mild thrombocytopenia from bone marrow suppression. Patients 4 and 5 had mild residual thrombocytopenias (platelet count >100 × 109/l) that could be immune-mediated or a drug side effect.\nPatient 6 developed a pulmonary embolism while on steroids and sirolimus, most likely caused by steroids and inflammatory nature of his disease. Sirolimus is not reported to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism without concurrent microangiopathy. He had a negative anti-phospholipid antibody screen and no evidence of microangiopathy.\nFig. 1.\n\nSirolimus improves lymphoproliferation, autoimmune cytopenias and double negative T cells in patients with ALPS. Four patients were treated with sirolimus for autoimmune cytopenias. Panels depict changes in platelet count (A), ANC (B) and haemoglobin (C). Patients 1 and 3 had autoimmune pancytopenia. Patient 2 only had autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Patient 4 had autoimmune neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The x-axis depicts time in weeks with data for every 2-week time points if available. NOTE change in scale after 16 weeks demarcated by vertical purple line. Week 0 (zero) is the time sirolimus was initiated. Arrows depict the time points when steroids were stopped. Panel D depicts peripheral blood DNTS (Double negative T cells; T cell phenotype: CD3+, CD4−, CD8−, TCRa/b+). DNTs were collected prior to initiating sirolimus and on therapy. All patients demonstrated significant reduction in DNTs. Post-treatment data point represents time 4–8 weeks after steroids stopped except for Patient 5 who had his level obtained on low dose steroids (5 mg every other day). Panel E depicts Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET–CT imaging, demonstrating a marked improvement in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in Patient 1 with ALPS after 3 months of treatment with sirolimus. Improvement was demonstrated in size of lymph nodes and spleen and in FDG-uptake. Upper panels represent pre-treatment (marked by arrows) and lower panels represent post-treatment.\nFive patients had significant lymphoproliferation (lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly) at the initiation of sirolimus therapy. One patient’s lymphoproliferation was controlled with steroids and thus he had no measurable lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly when sirolimus was initiated; he has not developed lymphoproliferation on sirolimus after stopping steroids. Of the five patients with lymphoproliferation at the time of sirolimus initiation, one patient had minimal response (no change in lymphadenopathy and mild improvement in splenomegaly), three patients had a complete response and one patient had a near-complete response with one 0·5-cm residual cervical lymph node. One patient had positive disease on a positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan immediately prior to initiating sirolimus; a follow-up scan after 3 months of treatment demonstrated resolution of PET-avid disease (Fig 1). We know of no other reported therapy producing such a dramatic response in refractory ALPS patients. As a biological marker of disease response, we compared peripheral blood DNTs prior to and after starting therapy with sirolimus. The percentage of DNTs was reduced by >50% in five of six patients (Fig 1) with an average decrease of 60% (P = 0·02) (range 41–74%). Of note, despite the reduction in DNTs, no patient had a reduction in total absolute lymphocyte count (ALC). Three patients were mildly lymphopenic at the initiation of sirolimus and two of these (Patients 1 and 3) had improvement of ALC to the normal range. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in any patient.\nDiscussion\nSirolimus (rapamycin) is a Federal Drug Administration-approved immunosuppressant that targets mTOR. Sirolimus has been in clinical use for over 20 years and its toxicities are well-described (Abdel-Karim & Giles, 2008). We hypothesized that mTOR inhibitors would be effective in patients with ALPS for three compelling reasons: (i) mTOR inhibitors induce cell death and apoptosis in abnormal lymphocytes; (ii) mTOR inhibitors, unlike most other immunosuppressive medications, increase peripheral blood regulatory T cells (Tregs) and (iii) mTOR inhibitors are safe and well-tolerated.\nCommon toxicities found in patients taking sirolimus include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and mucositis (Abdel-Karim & Giles, 2008). An increased risk of infections is very rare when used as a single agent; however, when combined with other immunosuppressive agents the risk increases. Sirolimus requires therapeutic drug monitoring to maximize effect and avoid toxicity.\nTreatment for patients with refractory ALPS is challenging. Many patients do not require chronic treatment, but for those patients who do there are only a few effective and tolerable agents. Currently a number of more targeted therapies are undergoing preclinical testing and clinical trials. Pyrimethamine and sulphadoxine were shown to reduce lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenias significantly in a small series of patients with ALPS; however, this combination failed to show any response in a different larger clinical trial (Ferrer et al, 2007). We have also recently shown that targeting the Notch signaling pathway may be beneficial in preclinical models of ALPS (Teachey et al, 2008), while other groups have shown that arsenic and histone deacetylase-inhibitors may be effective in preclinical models of ALPS (Ferrer et al, 2007). As with many autoimmune diseases, rituximab has been shown to be effective in a subset of ALPS patients; however, 5–10% of ALPS patients eventually develop common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and our group (unpublished observations) and others have seen an association between rituximab use and the development of CVID in ALPS patients (Dale et al, 2007). Moreover, the effects of rituximab are generally relatively transient; patients that do respond will probably relapse and with the potential risk of CVID, we recommend avoiding use of rituximab in ALPS patients. MMF was found to be effective in another series (Koneti Rao et al, 2005). While we have had less success overall with this drug, we have also seen good responses in a few children with ALPS treated with MMF (unpublished data).\nMMF inhibits lymphocyte proliferation but does not cause lymphocyte death and does not appear to increase Tregs (Noris et al, 2007). Tregs are a subset of T lymphocytes that suppress the activation of the immune system and increasing Treg numbers may improve autoimmune diseases (Brusko et al, 2008). Interestingly, some evidence suggests that peripheral blood DNTs may be dysregulated Tregs, while other evidence suggests they are cytotoxic T lymphocytes that have lost CD8 expression (Bleesing et al, 2001; Fischer et al, 2005). We have found mTOR inhibition decreases these abnormal DNTs in ALPS patients. Sirolimus has been shown to increase Tregs in healthy volunteers and patients with other autoimmune diseases (Battaglia et al, 2006). These observations, taken together, suggest the possibility that the improved responses with sirolimus seen here compared to other immunosuppressive agents, both in preclinical models and in patients, may be attributable to both induction of apoptosis in the abnormal lymphocytes and increases in normal Tregs. In subsequent patients, we plan to measure Tregs before and after initiating treatment with sirolimus. Unfortunately, as DNTs do not survive in culture, we could not directly test the in-vitro sensitivity of ALPS-patient’s DNTs to sirolimus.\nAs sirolimus can cause lymphocyte apoptosis and increase Tregs, it may also have activity in non-ALPS patients with autoimmune cytopenias, including patients with immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and autoimmune neutropenia, either as isolated idiopathic conditions or when associated with other autoimmune syndromes, including lupus or Evans syndrome. Our findings suggest that sirolimus may be superior to other agents currently used for or being investigated in these syndromes, including mercaptopurine, MMF, cyclosporine and tacrolimus. None of these agents are both lymphotoxic to both B and T cells while simultaneously increasing Tregs. Accordingly, we plan to open a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of sirolimus in patients with chronic ITP and chronic AIHA.\nWe found sirolimus was very effective in ameliorating autoimmune disease and lymphoproliferation in patients with ALPS, corroborating our previous preclinical work. Based on these results, we plan to continue to treat patients with ALPS and either steroid-refractory disease or who are steroid-intolerant with sirolimus and we have initiated a phase II efficacy trial of sirolimus in ALPS. Based on this trial, we anticipate that sirolimus may move to the frontline of therapy for patients with ALPS.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by grants from the United States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET, N01-A1-30070) (DTT), a Foerderer-Murray Award (DTT), the Larry and Helen Hoag Foundation Clinical Translational Research Career Development Award (DTT), the Goldman Philanthropic Partnerships and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (DTT) and the Sanford Chair and Weinberg Fund (SAG).\nFootnotes\nConflict of interest\nNo author has competing financial interests to declare.\nReferences\nACTIONS\nPERMALINK\nRESOURCES\n\n\n                            Similar articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                             Cited by other articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                                 Links to NCBI Databases\n                            \n\nCite\nAdd to Collections\n\n                            Connect with NLM\n                        \n\nNational Library of Medicine\n             8600 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20894\n\n",

We selected all original studies that included treatment outcomes. After the removal of duplicates, selection of abstracts and full-text articles, and quality assessment, we reviewed eligible articles for patient demographics, lymphatic malformation type, size or stage, site, clinical response rates, sirolimus administration route and dose, related adverse events, follow-up time, and concurrent treatments.\nResults\nAmong 153 unique citations, 19 studies were considered eligible, with reported treatment data for 97 paediatric patients. Most studies (n = 9) were case reports. Clinical response was described for 89 patients, in whom 94 mild-to-moderate adverse events were reported. The most frequently administered treatment regimen was oral sirolimus 0.8 mg/m2 twice a day, with the aim of achieving a blood concentration of 10–15 ng/mL.\nConclusion\nDespite promising results for sirolimus treatment in lymphatic malformation, the efficacy and safety profile of remains unclear due to the lack of high-quality studies. Systematic reporting of known side effects, especially in younger children, should assist clinicians in minimising treatment-associated risks. At the same time, we advocate for prospective multicentre studies with minimum reporting standards to facilitate improved candidate selection.\nKeywords: Vascular anomaly, Lymphangiomatosis, Paediatric mass, Rapamycin, Lymphatic malformation\nIntroduction\nThe International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classifies lymphatic malformations (LM) as low-flow vascular anomalies of the lymphatic system, often referred to with a misnomer such as lymphangiomas of cystic hygromas [1]. The incidence of LM is estimated to be 1.2–2.8 per 1000 births [2]. Around 50–60% of LM cases are present at birth, while approximately 80–90% will become evident by two years of age.\nThe pathogenetic mechanisms of LM are currently under debate [3]. However, recent findings of somatic genetic mutations in PIK3CA point to a developmental impairment of lymphatic channels due to improperly functioning endothelial cells [4]. The size of an LM usually increases proportionally in relation to the patient’s body growth. However, abrupt spurs are frequently observed, particularly following infection in drained tissues, trauma, and hormonal changes. Intracystic haemorrhages caused by lacerations of the septae where vessels run are another frequent cause of volume accretion. Frequently, all these occurrences are accompanied by acute symptoms such as pain, tenderness, and other signs of inflammation.\nThe most recent classification subdivides simple LM into macrocystic, microcystic, and combined LM [5]. Typical locations are the head and neck (approximately 60% of cases), proximal extremities, and trunk [6].\nLMs may appear as part of a syndrome, including generalised lymphatic anomaly, central conducting lymphatic anomaly, Gorham-Stout syndrome, kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, and other diseases associated with PIK3CA mutation, such as PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome (PROS).\nClinical presentation depends on the site and size of the malformation. Involvement of the respiratory tract is of special concern, since such LMs can cause tongue extrusion, jaw deformity, swallowing issues, and speech difficulties, and even lead to life-threatening conditions that obstruct the upper airways [5].\nTreatment options for lymphatic malformations are heterogeneous and include observation, sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, laser treatment, and surgical excision. The overall aim of treatment is functional and cosmetic and is focused on reducing the psychosocial burden of patients and families [7, 8].\nA personalised therapeutic approach is typically provided and depends on LM size, position, growth rate, and type, as spontaneous regressions have not been verified in the literature [9, 10]. Surgeries and sclerotherapy are usually effective for macrocystic LM, though size and position may reduce their feasibility and effectiveness. Conversely, surgery for microcystic LMs remains challenging due to their infiltrative nature [11]. Interstitial sclerotherapy has demonstrated encouraging microcystic LM results, with an approximate 50% reduction in volume [12, 13].\nIf more common options, such as surgery and sclerotherapy for LM, result in only modest efficacy or cannot be employed, rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, represents the current standard care for medical treatment.\nRapamycin is formally classed as a macrolide antibiotic drug. It owes its name to Rapa Nui (Easter Island) where it was first discovered from a soil sample containing Streptomyces hygroscopicus. The initial observed effect of rapamycin was modest antifungal activity. The drug was later adopted as part of a combination regimen for reducing the rejection of kidney transplants due to its immunosuppressant effects. It was subsequently studied as a potential drug for cancer since it demonstrated (weak) antiangiogenic effects. Sirolimus is active against the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine protein kinase considered a potential pathway of vascular malformation pathogenesis. The specific role of sirolimus in treating vascular malformations is linked to its ability to block the PIK/AKT/mTOR pathway [14].\nThe first case of LM treated with sirolimus was reported in 2011 [15]. Since then, many reports and case series have demonstrated the efficacy of sirolimus in reducing the size of LMs [16]. However, objective data on the effectiveness of this therapy are not currently available, particularly with regard to the paediatric population.\nThe present systematic review aimed to analyse current knowledge on the use of sirolimus as a treatment for LM in paediatric patients, not only in terms of its efficacy but also in terms of drug regimens and adverse events.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nAfter registering with the PROSPERO database (ID CRD42022314066), we conducted a systematic review between March 3, 2022, and February 10, 2023, according to PRISMA reporting guidelines [17]. We carried out systematic electronic searches for studies in English, Italian, German, French, and Spanish that reported original data on sirolimus treatment for paediatric head and neck lymphatic malformations.\nOn March 3, 2022, we searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for sirolimus and rapamycin in association with lymphovascular, cervicofacial, and paediatric search terms. Complete search strategies and the number of items retrieved from each database are provided in Table 1.\nSearch strategy details and items retrieved from each consulted database\nWe included studies in which sirolimus was used to treat LM that involved at a minimum the head and neck region of paediatric patients with reported treatment outcomes. We excluded meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews, which were nevertheless hand-checked for additional potentially relevant studies. No minimum study population was required. Mixed venolymphatic malformations were excluded from the review.\nAbstracts and full texts by different authors were reviewed in duplicate. At the abstract review stage, we included all studies that were deemed eligible by at least one rater. At the full-text review stage, disagreements were resolved by achieving consensus among raters.\nPICOS criteria\nThe Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study (PICOS) framework for the review was defined as follows:\nP: any paediatric patient with a simple lymphatic malformation involving the head and neck region.\nI: treatment with sirolimus, regardless of the administration route, dosage, and combination with other treatment(s).\nC: no comparator available.\nO: effectiveness of sirolimus treatment and adverse effects.\nS: all original study types, including case reports.\nStudy assessment and data extraction\nFor each study included, we recorded the following: study type, number of sirolimus-treated LMs, female to male ratio, patients’ age, type of LM (i.e. micro-, macrocystic, or mixed), clinical response rate, LM volume reduction (rate and assessment type), LM size or De Serres stage [18], LM site, sirolimus administration route and dose, sirolimus-related adverse events, follow-up time, and other prior, concurrent, or further treatments (the latest along with their timing). Two authors extracted data and rated studies in duplicate, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A clinical response was defined either as a significant LM reduction after sirolimus treatment and/or as an improvement in signs and symptoms caused by the LM after sirolimus treatment.\nStudies were assessed for both quality and methodological bias according to the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools (JBI-CAT) (for case reports) [19], the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Study Quality Assessment Tools (NHI-SQAT) [20] (for case series and cohort studies), and the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (for randomised clinical trials) [21]. Items were rated as ‘good’ if they fulfilled at least 80% of the items reported in the JBI-CAT or NHI-SQAT, ‘fair’ if they fulfilled between 50 and 80% of the items, and ‘poor’ if they fulfilled less than 50% of the items, respectively.\nThe level of evidence for clinical studies was scored according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (OCEBM) level of evidence guide [9, 22].\nDue to the considerable heterogeneity of study populations, study methods, and the predominantly qualitative nature of collected data, no initial meta-analysis was planned or performed a posteriori.\nResults\nAmong the 153 unique research items initially identified, 133 published reports were selected for full-text evaluation. No further report was identified for full-text evaluation after reference checking. Overall, 19 studies published between 2015 and 2021 were retained for analysis (see Fig. 1) [15, 23–40].\nFig. 1.\n\nPRISMA-style flow diagram of study selection during the systematic review process\nNine articles were case reports, seven were case series, and three were prospective cohort studies. Their level of evidence according to the OCEBM scale was IV (n = 16) and II (n = 3). Clinical articles were rated as good (n = 7) or fair (n = 12) according to NHI-SQAT tools, with no article receiving a rating of low quality. No significant biases towards the objectives of our systematic review were identified. Table 2 shows the study type, evidence, and quality rating for all studies included. Reported evidence was available for sirolimus treatment in 97 patients with LM and without a clear gender prevalence (34 females, 32 males, and 31 patients with gender not reported). The age range was broad, from intrauterine to 192 months. There was no evident prevalence for macro- or microcystic LM, and the size or stage was unevenly reported. More, specifically, LM type was reported in 66 patients, among whom 24 had macrocystic lesions, 17 microcystic lesions and 25 mixed lesions. Most patients had LM extending from the neck to at least one other region, with the mediastinum and tongue being the most frequent. Clinical response to sirolimus treatment was reported in 89 cases, although volume reductions were reported inconsistently. The clinical response rate was 23 out 24 cases for macrocystic lesions, 14 out 17 for microcystic lesions, and 21 out of 25 for mixed lesions. The route of administration was oral in all reported cases. The most frequent dose was 0.8 mg/m2, with the aim of achieving a therapeutic blood concentration of 10–15 ng/mL. Upper respiratory tract infections and mouth sores were the most frequently reported sirolimus-related adverse events. Sclerotherapy was the most frequent treatment preceding, following, or coinciding with sirolimus. Surgery was the second most employed associated treatment modality. Follow-up was extremely variable, ranging from 6 months to 5 years. Table 3 shows the demographic and clinical information for the treated patients, and Table 4 shows the data on treatment regimens, adverse events, concurrent treatments, and follow-up.\nTable 2.\nType of study, and evidence and quality rating of reviewed articles\nCR case report, CS case series, PCS prospective cohort study, OCEBM Oxford centre for evidence-based medicine, F fair, G good\nTable 3.\nDemographic and clinical information on the treated patients for all included studies\nNR not reported (at least for the lymphatic malformation population), Me median, Ra range, Av average, Mi microcystic, Ma macrocystic, DSS De Serres Stage, MRI magnetic resonance imaging\nTable 4.\nTreatment regimens, adverse events, and concurrent treatments for all included studies\nNR not reported (at least for the lymphatic malformation population), TBC target blood concentration, bid bis in die, qd quaque die, y years, mo months\nDiscussion\nOur systematic review, the first to focus on the role of sirolimus treatment for paediatric head and neck LM, confirms a growing interest in this therapeutic approach and mirrors the encouraging results obtained with sirolimus alone or in combination with surgery and sclerotherapy.\nStarting with, the pioneering work of Reinglas [15], case reports progressively gave way to more complex studies, culminating in a prospective study by Zhang et al., published in 2021 [39], thereby highlighting the interesting role for sirolimus in treating this challenging condition.\nOn one hand, the encouraging results provided by our systematic review (i.e. 89 out of 97 cases reported satisfactory treatment response) support the role of sirolimus in treating LM in children. Indeed, most studies included were of good or fair methodological quality. On the other hand, the lack of data from randomised controlled trials and the small size of the included case series underscores significant grey areas in the use of sirolimus for paediatric LM.\nFirst and foremost, there is a general lack of awareness in reporting patient data. Published studies lacking basic demographic information—or not allowing for the extraction of the data for subpopulations such as gender and age—were far too common in our review. It is clear from a medical standpoint that an infant a few months old might differ from a teenager, not only in terms of disease history but also from a more general perspective, and this difference plays a substantial role in planning complex treatment strategies. Even worse, the cystic type of the malformation, as well as its size, stage, and symptoms were often inconsistently reported, making it difficult to obtain a better understanding of which patients are more suitable for this type of treatment. While Zhang et al. [39] reported a significantly better response for macrocystic LM, good clinical response rates were also reported across microcystic and mixed LM studies. These findings are consistent with our extrapolated data, which did not show an obvious higher clinical response rate in any single type of LM. Furthermore, this lack of definition makes the assessment of the treatment results more intricate, and much is left to the authors’ interpretation. Also detrimental to the understanding of the results was a lack of use of the Cologne Score [41], an assessment that was developed to quantify the functional burden of LM in terms of disfigurement, dysphagia, dysphonia, and dyspnoea.\nThis present systematic review also explores the role of sirolimus in broader treatment protocols for LM. Given the relatively recent introduction of sirolimus as a therapy for LM, it is not surprising that in about half the studies included, sirolimus was introduced only after treatment failure or symptom recurrence with other more frequently employed treatment options, such as sclerotherapy [42, 43]. Even more interesting, albeit only occasionally reported [25, 26], was the concurrent use of sirolimus and sclerotherapy without related adverse events. Given the ethical concerns in treating such a rare and serious condition in children, the sclerotherapy/sirolimus combination could represent a starting point for a well-designed randomised trial that would shed some light on the specific role of sirolimus in the course of LM. Further treatments following sirolimus therapy typically fall into two groups, ablation/demolition, for which sirolimus acts as a neoadjuvant therapy, or further sclerotherapy, with sirolimus acting to stabilise the LM growth or reduce the overall treatment volume.\nThe data emerging from the systematic analysis of sirolimus-related adverse events are far more complex. For a simple analysis, as shown in Table 4, it is apparent that the frequency of reported adverse events was proportional to the size of the patient population in each study, with case reports mentioning few to no complications, and larger case series such as that by Strychowsky et al. and Zhang et al. reporting 2.13 and 0.93 events, respectively, per treated paediatric patient [36, 39]. The reduced incidence of adverse events in case reports seemed to point towards a degree of reporting bias. Consequently, even if most events were mild, primarily with mucosa- or skin involvement, we advocate for proactive surveillance, particularly in the paediatric population. Such surveillance is even more critical, and inextricably connected to treatment efficacy evaluation, if we consider that wider reports suggest a lower incidence of adverse events with lower target plasma concentrations of sirolimus [44]. Preliminary data from our review show that such lower plasma concentrations also retain their effect for LM.\nIn the context of this systematic review, we strived to minimise bias in the selection of articles and extraction of the data. With this in mind, we did not choose time limits for our searches and included all article types to maximise the knowledge base. Nevertheless, we are indeed aware that the inclusion of case reports introduces a significant publication bias towards good results (or as a general rule, based on this review), extremely dire adverse events [45]. We believe that allowing for such bias was a fair compromise due to the lack of literature focusing on this rare disease. Another limitation of our study was the impossibility of assessing therapeutic success objectively, as neither volume reductions nor other specific metrics were consistently reported across articles. Instead, we chose to report the clinical response rate, adhering to each article authors’ view on what could be considered as such. This need for consistent reporting (which should start with using De Serres stages [18] and the Cologne Score System) is a major feature upon which future studies should focus. Last, but not least, to minimise heterogeneity, we excluded from this review venolymphatic malformations and complex LM, which are addressed even more sparsely in the literature but remain a potential target for sirolimus therapy. In addition, a few crucial aspects were missing from the data reviewed. First, the nature and degree of sirolimus-related infections, which are feared and frequently discussed complications. Even more importantly, there were no data on the long-term risks of treatment with sirolimus in the paediatric population. In fact, there no data were reported on the ideal duration of treatment, with some authors advocating for a ‘short course’ of 6–12 months and others suggesting the need for a treatment duration of indefinite length. This discrepancy raises potential concerns that are implicit based on the biological action of the drug.\nConclusion\nOur findings confirm that sirolimus is a potential treatment for simple LM, with encouraging clinical response rates and manageable side effects. Further characterisation of affected patients and LM, including an improved definition of therapeutic ranges and a systematic evaluation of treatment results would allow for a more targeted selection of candidates, with improved overall results. We advocate further for multicentre and ultimately randomised, studies on sirolimus treatment for LM, and for improved care and effective treatment options for this vulnerable paediatric population.\nAuthor contributions\nAll authors contributed to the study conception and design.

Treatment with sirolimus has the potential to improve symptoms and downsize lymphatic malformations. This systematic review summarizes the current information about sirolimus treatment of lymphatic malformations of the head and neck in children, its efficacy and side effects.\nMethods\nA systematic search of the literature regarding studies on sirolimus treatment of children with lymphatic malformations of the head and neck was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar up to July 2021 with the search terms “lymphatic malformation”, “lymphangioma”, “cystic hygroma”, “low-flow malformation”, “sirolimus”, “rapamycin”, “mTOR inhibitor” and “children”.\nResults\nIn all, 28 studies including 105 children from newborn to 17 years treated with sirolimus for lymphatic malformations of the head and neck were analyzed. The most frequent initial dose was 0.8 mg/m2 per dose, twice daily at 12-h interval. The target blood level differed between studies, 10–15 ng/mL and 5–15 ng/mL were most often used. More than 91% of the children responded to sirolimus treatment which lasts from 6 months to 4 years. Typical side effects were hyperlipidemia, neutropenia and infections.\nMethods\nSirolimus could be an effective treatment for children with large complicated lymphatic malformations of the head and neck. As not all patients will benefit from treatment, the decision to treat sirolimus should be made by a multidisciplinary team.\nKeywords: Lymphatic malformation, Children, Sirolimus, Rapamycin\nIntroduction\nLymphatic malformations (LM) are congenital developmental anomalies of the lymphatic system with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2000 live births [1]. Depending on the size of the cysts LM are categorized into macrocystic (> 1 cm), microcystic (< 1 cm), or mixed lesions. LM are usually diagnosed at birth or in the first two years of life, whereas large LM can also be diagnosed prenatally, and some LM have delayed presentation in adulthood. The precise pathogenesis of LM is still unknown but in some patients they are associated with syndromic disorders like Proteus and CLOVES syndrome [2, 3]. LM most frequently occur in the head and neck region, but they can also be found in other parts of the body, especially in lymphatic-rich areas. Symptoms depend on the size and location of LM. In the head and neck area, symptoms can range from minimal swelling to life-threatening airway obstruction, impaired oral feeding, macroglossia, overgrowth of the mandible, loss of vision, pain and aesthetic disfigurement [4, 5]. Relapsing periods of infection, trauma or intracystic hemorrhage can lead to acute enlargement while LM usually grows proportional to the patients’ body growth.\nThe management of LM often necessitates a multidisciplinary approach and an individualized treatment depending on symptoms, presence of functional compromise, size and location. Surgery is a mainstay of treatment, especially in microcystic and mixed LM. Sclerotherapy is particularly effective in macrocystic LM and as an adjunctive therapy used in combination with surgery. There were different possible sclerosants, however, picibanil (OK-432) and doxycycline are most often used [6]. Laser therapy to vaporize the tissue and seal superficial lymphatic channels is mainly effective in mucosal LM. In absence of functional deficits and symptoms watch-and-wait may also may also be an option. Pharmacologic treatment with different drugs has also been considered for the treatment of large LM, especially in patients who were refractory to conventional treatments. The most promising systemic treatment seems to be sirolimus that was demonstrated to be useful in the therapy of certain diseases and has been shown to inhibit lymphangiogenesis [7–10].\nSirolimus is also known as rapamycin, as it was initially discovered in a soil sample of Rapa Nui (Easter Island). It is a natural macrolide derived from the soil bacteria Streptomyces hygrosopicus. Sirolimus is a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase that is a key factor in the regulation of angiogenesis, cell growth and proliferation. Sirolimus was approved by the FDA in 1999 as an oral immunosuppressive for use in renal transplantation and in 2015 as the first drug to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a rare disease that is characterized by progressive, cystic lung disease, angiomyolipoma and lymphangioleiomyomas and predominately affects young women. Owing to its antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties, sirolimus treatment was used to treat large LM. In a previous systematic review, it could be demonstrated that treatment with sirolimus has the potential to improve symptoms and downsize LM of different body areas [11]. The present review aims to analyze the available information about efficacy and side effects in children with LM of the head and neck.\nMaterial and methods\nA systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar. The search terms “lymphatic malformation”, “lymphangioma”, “cystic hygroma”, “low-flow mal-formation”, “sirolimus”, “rapamycin”, “mTOR inhibitor” and “children” were used in “AND” and “OR” combinations. The search was limited to articles published until July 2021. All studies focusing on systemic sirolimus therapy for head and neck LM in children (< 18 years) that were presented in English, Spanish, French and German languages were eligible for inclusion. Studies reporting non-original data (systematic reviews, meta-analyses, narrative reviews, commentaries, correspondence, letters), studies addressing both adults and children or LM of locations inside and outside the head and neck and that did not report data from the head and neck or children separately, duplicate publications, as well as reports with insufficient information were excluded. Reports on topical treatment were also excluded. In addition to the electronic database search, the reference sections of previous systematic reviews and the included articles were checked for further potentially relevant articles. The literature search and the evaluation of inclusion criteria were performed by the first author with uncertainties resolved through consultation among all the authors. The initial screening was based on the titles and/or abstracts. Next, the hard copies of the potentially eligible publications were examined to assess whether they met the inclusion criteria. Reports on the generalized lymphatic anomaly, Gorham-Stout disease, lymphangiomatosis, lymphangiectasia, and chronic lymphedema as well as studies on patients with venolymphatic and capillary-lymphatico-venous malformations were not included in this review.\nFor each selected report, the following variables were considered: year and country of publication, study design, number of cases described, sex and age of the patients, location of LM, treatment (including dosage and target serum level), treatment duration, outcome, adverse events and follow-up.\nResults\nClinical characteristics of the patients\nIn all, 28 case series and case reports and two prospective trials [31, 36] including 105 children treated with sirolimus for LM of the head and neck, were included in this review (Table 1) [12–39]. Due to the inclusion criteria, the age of the patients ranged from newborn to 17 years. The male to female ratio was 1:1.21, but the sex was not reported for all patients. In 51 patients (48.6%), pretreatment using other modalities was reported to be insufficient without adequate response. The most common pretreatments were sclerotherapy (n = 30), surgery (n = 7) and the combination of surgery and sclerotherapy (n = 7). Other pretreatments were intralesional triamcinolone, steroids combined with propranolol, sildenafil and propranolol, prednisone, laser therapy as well as surgery combined with laser therapy.\nStudies concerning sirolimus therapy of lymphatic malformations of the head and neck in children\n4 Mo\n1 Mo\nM\nNR\nLaser surgery\nNo\nPR\nPR\n2y,\n8 mo discontinued, 5 mo (onging)\n11 mo (ongoing)\nNeck\nParotid/neck\n20 Mo\n12 Y\nF\nM\n6 weeks (ongoing)\n8 weeks (ongoing)\n2 M\n1 F\n1 > 6 Months\n1 > 2 Months\nNR\nRetroorbital\ncervical\n2 Mo\n12 Years\n10 Mo (ongoing)\n2y (ongoing)\n0,64Y-3,42Y\n4 patients ongoing (1,55–2,98 Y)\nCellulitis (6)\nNausea/emesis (3)\nEczema (6)\nMouth sores (9)\nTransaminitis (5), elevated cholesterol and troglycerides (4)\nNeutropenia (3)\nRash (1)\nAcne (1)\nDiarrhea (1)\nHeadache (3)\nAlopecia (1)\nIrregular menstrual Bleeding (1)\n2 F\n1 M\n2 PR\n1 SD\n13 Mo,\n34 Mo\n28 Mo ongoing\n3 F,\n3 M\n1 CR\n5 PR\nElevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (1) and triglycerides (1)\nlymphangitis (3), intralesional bleeding (2)\n2 Mo\n4 Y\n13 Y\n10mo ongoing (1)\n1,5 y (2)\nHypertransaminasemia (1)\nhypercholesterinemia (1)\n21 D\n9 weeks\n1 m,\n1 NR\n3,5–6\n4–12\n2 weeks,\n10 mo, 1 y, 2 y, 11 y\n2 m,\n3 f\n4 PR\n1 SD\n14 PR (9 > 75%, 5 > 50%)\n2 SD\n4 Y ongoing\n4 Y ongoing\n14 Mo ongiong\n0.8 mg/m2 per dose twice daily\n0.5 mg/m2 per dose daily in neonates\n5 F,\n3 M\nMouth sores (6), eczema (1), gastrointestinal reaction (2), dyslipidemia (1), neutropenia (1)\nOne patient interrupted sirolimus therapy for recurrent fever caused by upper respiratory tract infection\nAbbreviations: y year, mo months, d days, m male, f female, NR not reported, NE not evaluable, PR partial response, PD progressive disease\nTreatment with sirolimus\nIn most studies, sirolimus was administered orally at an initial dosage of 0.8 mg/m2 per dose, twice daily at 12-h intervals [13, 17, 19, 21, 23–26, 28, 34, 36, 39]. In other studies, this was modified to 0.8 mg/m2 per day [29], 0.8 mg per day in three doses [32], or 0.08 mg/kg per day [30]. Zhang reported to use a reduced starting dose in neonates (0.5 mg/m2). Other starting doses were 1–2 mg per day [31], 0.1 mg/kg per day [35], 0.05 mg/kg twice daily [16], 0.6 mg/m2 per twice daily dose [33], 0.07 mg/kg twice daily [18], 0.4–0.8 mg/m2 twice daily [20] or in two fractions [27], and 1.5 mg/kg/day administered in two divided daily doses [37]. In five publications, the initial dose of sirolimus was not reported [12, 14, 15, 22, 38]. After the beginning of treatment with sirolimus the dose was then subsequently adjusted to reach the planned target blood level.\nThe target blood level of sirolimus was ≤ 20 ng/mL in all studies but slightly differed. The target blood level was 10–15 ng/mL in seven studies [14, 17, 20, 23, 24, 26, 39], 5–15 ng/mL in four studies [16, 28, 31, 34] and 4–12 ng/mL in two studies [25, 30]. In one study each, 3.5–6 ng/mL [30], 4–8 ng/mL [21], 4–10 ng/mL [38], 4–13 ng/mL [36], 5–12 ng/mL [33], 10–12 ng/mL [27], 10–13 ng/mL [19] and 12–20 ng/mL [35] were the target concentrations. Eight studies did not report the target blood level of sirolimus [12, 13, 15, 18, 22, 29, 32, 37]. Not in all studies the planned target trough level for sirolimus was achieved [14, 20]. For example, Margolin et al. [14] reported that the sirolimus level was often < 2 ng/mL. Despite difficulties with maintaining the desired sirolimus levels, there was a significant reduction in LM size in the presented case [14].\nThe time-to-response was not reported in all studies and seem to be variable. For example, Azouz et al. reported a reduction of 70–80% of the LM after 10 days of treatment [18]. Akyüz et al. [13] and Yesil et al. [17] reported a decrease in size of 60% and 70% after 3 months, respectively. Gomez-Sanchez et al. [34] reported a clinical response time from 3.5 to 9 months, Amodeo et al. [20] reported about a response after two months of treatment, while Gonzalez-Hermosa et al. [29] reported 13 months.\nIn 24 studies, data on the duration of treatment were presented [13–31, 34, 35]. The duration of sirolimus treatment ranged from 6 months to 4 years. In many patients, sirolimus treatment was ongoing at the time of the report.\nParallel treatments additionally to sirolimus were performed in seven cases (6.7%) [15, 19, 20, 30, 35, 38]. In one patient sirolimus was combined with sclerotherapy and laser therapy [35], in two patients with surgery [20, 38], in one patient with laser surgery [15], and in three patients with sclerotherapy [19, 30].\nTreatment efficacy\nIn all, 96 children (91.4%) responded to sirolimus treatment, 95 patients had a partial response, in one neonate a complete response was reported [25]. This neonate with a large macrocystic cervicofacial LM was treated with sirolimus from the 15th day of live for twelve months. Due to a total involution of the LM at 12 months of life treatment was stopped. There was no recurrence one year later.\nIn many trials, the volume reduction was not quantified. Terms like “marked improvement”, “significant volume reduction” or “significant decrease” were used. For this reason, a comparison of the results is only possible to a limited extent. In those studies, were the percentage of volume reduction was reported, the reductions were between 49 and 90% [12, 13, 17, 30, 32]. Independent of the decrease of LM, Hammer et al. reported an improvement in pain in all patients [24].\nSide effects\nTwenty-three studies commented on possible adverse events associated with and probably being a result of sirolimus therapy [15–17, 19–31, 33–39]. In five studies no patients experienced side effects [15, 22, 29, 30, 37]. In the other 18 studies, different adverse effects were reported [16, 17, 19–21, 23–28, 31, 33–36, 38, 39], the most common were hyperlipidemia, neutropenia and infections such as cellulitis. There was no reporting of adverse events graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). In three studies [23, 27, 36] sirolimus was interrupted or stopped in some cases due to adverse events. For example, Strychowsky et al. described two patients who interrupted sirolimus therapy for adverse events, in one case intravenous antibiotics were given, the other 13-year-old patient developed alopecia but chose to resume sirolimus 4 months after stopping [23]. Zhang et al. reported that sirolimus was intermittently interrupted due to drug side effects in some cases. The adverse events did not correlate with the blood level of sirolimus [36].\nIn 46 patients (43.8%) from five studies [22, 23, 31, 32, 34] a prophylactic administration of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia infection was performed. Occurrence of bacterial pneumonia during sirolimus therapy was only reported in one of all investigated cases [27], the causative bacterium was not reported. The sirolimus therapy was withheld in this case, and the girl was treated with a 2-week course of imipenem [27].\nDiscussion\nAlthough it is an off-label use, sirolimus has been used for the treatment of vascular anomalies for more than a decade [40, 41] and there is a growing evidence on the effective role of sirolimus in treating LM. In the presented analysis, 90% of the children with LM of the head and neck responded to sirolimus. Besides volume reduction, pain relief and mucosal and skin changes were described. Despite the availability of molecular data demonstrating the impact of sirolimus on various intracellular signaling pathways, the mechanism of action of sirolimus in LM is—also due to the limited understanding of the biology and genetics of LM—not completely understood. The response to sirolimus seems to depend on the microvessel density within the LM suggesting an interference with angiogenetic and lymphogenetic growth factor signaling pathways. Pandey et al. [32] demonstrated that mean lymphatic microvessel density, which was calculated immunohistochemically using the monoclonal antibody D2-40 as the lymphatic endothelial marker, was significantly different in good responders, partial and non-responders to sirolimus. Therefore, they concluded that lymphangiogenesis is a valuable predictive biomarker for the therapeutic response to sirolimus in children with LM [32]. Hori et al. [42] analyzed the activation of the mTOR pathway in a subset of lymphatic anomalies in vivo and demonstrated that normal lymphatic vessels expressed neither mTOR nor its phosphorylated form p‐mTOR. In contrast to normal lymphatic vessels, endothelial cells of LM, kaposiform lymphangiomatosis and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma expressed mTOR. An activation of mTOR was seen in kaposiform lymphangiomatosis and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma but not in LM, whereas the activation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1, an indicator of activated mTOR signaling), and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E‐binding protein (4EBP1) which mediate an increase in protein synthesis and cell growth in lymphangiogenesis was seen in all cases of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and 40% of LM. Although sirolimus is effective in LM, most of the LM were negative for its phosphorylated form p‐mTOR. Hori et al. explained this fact by possible dual inhibition of mTOR and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway by sirolimus in lymphatic anomalies which both play a vital role in lymphangiogenesis [42, 43]. They assumed that sirolimus may inhibit lymphangiogenesis at least in part by downregulating VEGF expression in p‐mTOR negative cases [42] as it was previously demonstrated that sirolimus treatment also inhibited the expression of VEGFR‐3 and VEGF‐C, the potent growth factors for lymphatic endothelial cells [44, 45]. However, prospective randomized trials concerning this issue are lacking.\nStrychowsky et al. [23] reported that macrocystic LM may respond better than mixed or microcystic LM, and younger patients may respond better than older patients to sirolimus. It could be demonstrated that sirolimus can be well-tolerated even in preterm children [35]. It is unclear if there is variable efficacy of sirolimus treatment during different developmental time periods. Pre-treated patients seem to respond less well [23] but there may be synergistic effects with other treatments like sclerotherapy or surgery [18].\nThe duration of sirolimus treatment differed between the analyzed studies. Most children were treated for several months and sirolimus was not withdrawn at last follow-up. Freixo et al. [46] demonstrated for vascular anomalies that 75% of the first clinical response was reported in less than 21 days. In this review, the time to (reported) clinical response varied between 10 days [18] and 13 months [29]. However, the time to reach the optimum treatment effect remains unclear.\nThe ability to measure serum levels of sirolimus makes sirolimus treatment controllable to a certain extent. However, a serum level for an effective and safe treatment has not been defined so far. The optimal doses and corresponding plasma levels for each patient to achieve response are still not defined. The target levels, however, were most frequently 5 to 15 ng/mL. Most authors maintained sirolimus at the standard dose. Some authors recommend to reduce the dose after response to sirolimus reached a plateau for some months [23, 25] to achieve the minimal effective dose for each patient to remain asymptomatic. Also, after discontinuation of the drug, some patients had stable disease.\nThe off-label use of sirolimus in children with LM requires a thoughtful risk–benefit analysis and careful follow-up. Children treated with sirolimus for LM may be at a significant risk for severe adverse events and therefore should be monitored carefully. A retrospective chart review in different European centers demonstrated that most serious adverse events were observed in the first year of sirolimus therapy; but serious adverse events can also occur after a longer treatment period [41]. The occurrence of serious adverse events during sirolimus treatment did not seem to be dependent on the sirolimus blood level [41].\nOne infrequent but severe side effect is Pneumocystis Jirovecii pneumonia, which was reported in patients who underwent solid organ transplants and two patients with vascular anomalies treated with sirolimus [47–49]. Therefore, prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprime is recommended by some authors [22, 23, 31, 32, 34, 41]. In the presented patient group, nearly half of the children received prophylactic antibiotic treatment with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprime [22, 23, 31, 32, 34]. However, anti-infectious prophylactic measures were not standardized as data are lacking. Occurrence of bacterial pneumonia during sirolimus therapy was only reported in one of the presented patients [27], however, the causative bacterium was not reported. It is suspected that higher levels of sirolimus or concomitant medications such as corticosteroids may be a risk factor for Pneumocystis pneumonia [25] and therefore selected patients may benefit from Pneumocystis prophylaxis while on sirolimus.\nThis systematic review is not without limitations. Inherent to the design we have to deal with missing data which could have impacted the results. We observed a lack in standardization in reporting and its comprehensiveness as relevant details often were missing. In many studies, outcome measures were qualitative and not quantitative, moreover, the outcome was reported at different timepoints. There were variations in the age of the patients and treatment phases (with/without prior treatment), clinical management and treatment durations. The methodological quality of the included studies is low and there was a heterogeneity regarding drug dosage, definition of response, measurement of response and measurement of toxicity. Finally, there may be publication bias with respect to centers publishing good outcomes.\nConclusion\nSirolimus could be an effective treatment in children with large complicated LM of the head and neck. Until now, data are lacking to define the optimal place of sirolimus in the management strategy. Patients and their parents should be well educated on potential adverse effects and the decision for sirolimus treatment should be made by a multidisciplinary team. However, not all patients benefit from treatment. Therefore, it will be important to define factors predicting response to sirolimus treatment and patients who will benefit from sirolimus. Possibly, the expression of key components of the mTOR signaling pathway (S6K1) and VEGF C and VEGFR3 can serve as a biomarker predicting treatment success. There is a need for further clinical trials in children with head and neck LM establishing the perfect timepoint for initiation and the duration of sirolimus treatment and optimal doses, which will likely depend on the phenotype and extension of the LM, the age of the child and the symptoms.\nFunding\nOpen Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.\nFootnotes\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nReferences\nArticles from European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology are provided here courtesy of Springer\nACTIONS\nPERMALINK\nRESOURCES\n\n\n                            Similar articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                             Cited by other articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                                 Links to NCBI Databases\n                            \n\nCite\nAdd to Collections\n\n                            Connect with NLM\n                        \n\nNational Library of Medicine\n             8600 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20894\n\n",

Conventional treatments, such as surgery and/or sclerotherapy, are rarely curative, underscoring the great need for new therapeutic modalities. Recent preclinical and clinical data demonstrated that sirolimus could offset the progression of vascular malformations and significantly improve quality of life of patients through inhibition of the Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment in patients with extensive or complex slow-flow vascular malformations.\nMethods\nSirolimus was administered orally on a continuous dosing schedule with pharmacokinetic-guided target serum concentration level of 10 to 15 ng/ml. Patients were seen every month for the first three months and subsequently every three months. The primary endpoints were safety and efficacy, based on clinical, biological and radiological evaluations, as well as a quality of life questionnaire.\nResults\nNineteen patients, from 3 to 64 years old, with lymphatic (LM), venous (VM) or complex slow-flow malformations, refractory to standard care, were enrolled and received sirolimus continuously. After 12 months of follow-up, 16 patients were available for assessment of efficacy and safety: all had a significant and rapid improvement of their symptoms and quality of life. In two patients, sirolimus treatment permitted sclerotherapy and surgery, initially evaluated unfeasible. Sirolimus was well tolerated, with mucositis as the most common (10% of patients) grade 3 adverse event.\nConclusions\nSirolimus was efficient in extensive LM, VM and/or complex malformations that were refractory to conventional treatments and was well tolerated.\nKeywords: Sirolimus, Rapamycin, Venous malformation, Lymphatic malformation, Complex vascular malformation, Slow-flow anomaly, Extensive vascular anomaly\nBackground\nVascular malformations are rare structural anomalies of blood and lymphatic vessels. Depending on the affected vessel type, these malformations are divided into capillary, venous, lymphatic, arteriovenous or combined malformations [1–3]. They are usually present at birth but can appear during childhood or adulthood [4].\nVenous malformations (VM) often cause deformation, pain, chronic anaemia and important functional restraint. About 50% of VMs have associated coagulation abnormalities with high D-dimer and normal-to-low fibrinogen levels. This localized intravascular coagulopathy is relatively specific for VM and is used as a diagnostic test [5–8].\nLymphatic malformations (LM) are micro- or macrocystic, or mixed, and can be localized or diffuse, as observed in generalized lymphatic anomalies (GLA). They can cause deformation, infiltration and compression of vital structures, similar to VM. They are often associated with oozing, bruizing and chronic infections [9].\nCombined malformations also exist. Typical are the capillary-lymphatico-venous malformations with or without overgrowth of the affected limb (formerly known as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, KTS) and the complex vascular malformations (e.g. arterio-venous or venous malformations) seen in the PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS) [10, 11].\nThe diagnosis of a vascular malformation is usually based on history and physical examination. Further investigations include Doppler ultrasonography, MRI and D-dimer and fibrinogen level measurements to identify a venous component and/or to exclude a coagulation abnormality [12]. Sclerotherapy alone or in combination with surgical resection is the gold standard procedure for most slow-flow vascular malformations [13, 14]. These procedures are rarely curative in patients with extensive and infiltrating lesions. Thus, an important unmet medical need exists.\nThe tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2 and its ligands angiopoietin-1 and -2, play a key role in vascular maturation and stability through the Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway. Up to 60% of VMs are due to somatic TIE2 mutations, resulting in ligand-independent activation of the receptor [15–20]. Another 20% of VMs are due to somatic activating mutations of PIK3CA encoding for the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K [21]. These mutations lead to a sustained activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, responsible for accumulation of endothelial cells due to reduced apoptosis and defective recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells [15, 22–24], which results in the enlarged, convoluted venous channels. Recently, the first animal model of VM was developed through injection of TIE2-mutated human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs subcutaneously into nude mice. In this model, sirolimus administration stopped the growth of VM-lesions [22]. Similarly, somatic/mosaic PIK3CA mutations are found in the majority of LM and complex malformations (KTS), underscoring mTOR activation as an interesting target for medical treatment of slow-flow vascular malformations [22].\nSirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR. It is used in a number of medical disciplines, especially as an immunosuppressive drug to prevent organ rejection, as an anti-angiogenic medication on coated cardiologic stents and as a cytostatic agent in breast and renal cancer. Moreover, our pilot study and two previously reported trials showed efficacy in selected vascular malformations [22, 25, 26]. We now performed a monocentric prospective phase II clinical trial to evaluate sirolimus efficacy and safety for patients (children and adults) with extensive and/or complex slow-flow vascular malformations that were refractory to standard treatments.\nMethods\nPatients\nInclusion criteria included symptomatic slow-flow vascular malformations that were refractory to standard care, such as sclerotherapy and/or surgical resection. Chronic pain, functional restraint, recurrent infections (defined as > 3 episodes/year), oozing, bleeding and/or coagulation abnormality were the symptoms considered for inclusion in the study.There was no age limitation. The eligible patients had to have adequate liver (bilirubin, ASAT, ALAT), medullar (neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 8,0 mg/dl and platelets ≥ 50.000/mm3) and renal function (clearance ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73m2) with a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50. If partial surgical resection was performed, the tissues were screened for presence of somatic TIE2 or PIK3CA mutations, as described [21].\nExclusion criteria included severe, concurrent and/or uncontrolled diseases (cardiopathy, diabetes, infection, HIV, hypertension...), concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducer intake, gastro-intestinal disorders that might modify sirolimus absorption, pregnancy and lactation for women. Patients could not have had a surgical resection and/or sclerotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Exclusion criteria also included previous use of an mTOR inhibitor.\nStudy protocol and treatment\nThis is a crossover trial using patient’s long-term clinical, biological and radiological history before sirolimus treatment as control [27]. Pre-treatment analysis included D-dimer and fibrinogen level measurements, and MRI studies using T1-weighted imaging without gadolinium chelate injection, T2-weighted imaging with Fat Saturation and/or STIR sequences in two orthogonal planes.\nSirolimus was started with a dose of 0.8 mg/m2 body surface, twice-a-day, using liquid solutions for children under the age of 12 years, and with a single dose of 2 mg/day, using a tablet, for older patients. All patients were seen every month for the first 3 months, then every 3 months in order to evaluate the signs and symptoms of the malformation, compliance and possible side-effects of the drug. After 1 week of treatment, sirolimus serum level was measured and daily sirolimus dose was adapted to reach a blood level between 10 to 15 ng/ml. If the patient experienced grade 3–4 toxicities, sirolimus dose was decreased. Hemogram, liver and renal function, coagulation parameters and thyroid tests were monitored every 3 months.\nTreatment was suspended in cases of severe toxicity, patient and/or parents who refused to continue, and patients who did not experience any benefit after 3 months of therapy. For all patients enrolled in this study, a follow-up is planned for 5 years.\nThe primary endpoint was efficacy and safety of sirolimus at 12 months. Efficacy of the medication was evaluated based on physical (clinical size, colour and consistency of the lesion), functional (organ dysfunction, mobility restraint, pain, bleeding, oozing, repetitive infections), biological (measurement of coagulation parameters) and radiological response, as well as on quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. Clinical examination and measurement of lesions were performed at each consultation. Evaluation of pain was based on visual analog scale (VAS) for adult and on the faces pain scale for children, both ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (excessive pain). Radiological evaluation was based on the comparison between the pre-study MRI and the MRI performed at one-year follow-up. Imaging analysis was completed by using the ITK-SNAP3–0 software from the DICOM source images, to obtain an objective quantification of the volume of the malformation [28, 29]. This program required a manual or semi-automatic contouring of the lesions on the MRI slices, which subsequently generated a 3-dimensional image and volume calculation. QoL was based on a questionnaire modified from Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (MOS SF-36) for adults. Specific questionnaires from “Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory” (PEDSQL) were used for infants from age 5–7 years, 8–12 years and 13–18 years, and a corresponding questionnaire for their respective parents (www.pedsql.org). Moreover, a global self-evaluation percentage (0% = no change to 100% = symptom free; improvement was considered as weak between 0 and 20%, moderate between 20 and 50% and strong when superior to 50%) was recorded for each patient and/or parents at each consultation. Coagulation changes (D-dimer and fibrinogen levels) were also recorded. Adverse events were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.\nResponse was defined as follows:\nComplete response (CR), defined as a complete disappearance of the lesion (clinical and/or radiological), of the symptoms and normalisation of QoL.\nPartial response (PR), defined as a reduction of ≥20% in size of the vascular lesion (clinical and/or radiological), improvement of symptoms and/or QoL.\nAbsence of response (AR), defined as a progressive disease (increase in size, symptoms and decreased QoL) or disease stability (reduction of < 20% in size and no improvement of symptoms and QoL).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version 24.0 [30]. Paired sample t-tests were applied with a significance threshold of 0.05.\nResults\nNineteen patients, 12 females and 7 males, aged from 3 to 64 years (median: 15 years) were enrolled between January 2011 and January 2015. Six patients had a LM, two had a generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA), seven had a VM, one had a capillary venous malformation (CVM), two had KTS and one had PHTS. Characteristics of patients are described in Table 1.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of patients before and after 1 year of sirolimus treatment\nF female, M male, y years, LM lymphatic Malformation, GLA Generalized Lymphatic Anomaly, VM Venous Malformation, CVM Capillary Venous Malformation, KTS Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome, PHTS PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome, LMWH Low Molecular Weight Heparin, VAS Visual Analogue Scale, MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nAll but one patient had previously been treated with several sequences of sclerotherapies and/or surgical resection. All had severe symptoms varying from esthetic deformation (n = 15), chronic pain (VAS 3–10) refractory to conventional medications (n = 13), organ or mobility dysfunction (n = 17), recurrent infections (n = 10), bleeding (n = 4), and/or oozing (n = 4). All patients had a poor QoL. Of the 11 patients with a venous component, 10 (90%) had elevated D-dimer levels and 1 VM (#9) had low fibrinogen levels before sirolimus initiation.\nSixteen patients received sirolimus for at least 12 months; two stopped earlier because of grade 3 mucositis and one spontaneously decided to stop the study. Thirteen patients are still on treatment, with a follow-up ranging from 15 to 48 months.\nEfficacy\nSixteen patients were evaluated for efficacy after 1 year of sirolimus treatment (Table 2). A partial response was observed in all patients (n = 16/16). There was no complete response.\nEfficacy after 1 year of sirolimus treatment\nFU Follow-Up, LM Lymphatic Malformation, GLA Generalized Lymphatic Anomaly, VM Venous Malformation, CVM Capillary Venous Malformation, KTS Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome, PHTS PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome, n/a not applicable\nIn patients with visible vascular malformations sirolimus resulted in a noticeable improvement in appearance compared to previous photographs in 11 patients at 1 year time-point (Figs. 1 and 2) resulting in an clinical response rate of 78%. This improvement appeared within 3 months from the start of sirolimus in all of these patients and persisted at 6- and 12-month evaluation points. No clinical disappearance of the lesion was observed but the volume reduction induced by sirolimus allowed sclerotherapy for patient #2 and surgical resection for patient #17. The patient who stopped sirolimus after 2 months because of grade 3 mucositis (#11) did not have any physical improvement during this short period.\n\nPatient #3 with a cervico-facial microcystic LM before initiation of sirolimus (a) and after 12 months of treatment (b)\n\nPatient #17 with a capillaro-lymphatico-venous malformation with hypertrophy (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome) before initiation of sirolimus (a) and after 6 months of treatment (b)\nAll patients experienced improvement in mobility or organ function, reduction of pain, bleeding or oozing, or reduction or cessation of infections, resulting in a 100% general improvement rate. These appeared within 3 months from the start of sirolimus and were maintained. Similarly, patient #11 (with a limited 2-month-treatment) experienced improvement in mobility.\nPain improved in all evaluable patients (n = 10) (Fig. 3). These patients suffered from chronic pain (VAS ranging from 3 to 10) with frequent painful crises commonly reaching at least VAS 8. Median VAS score for baseline continuous pain decreased from 6 to 2 at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up and this improvement persisted at 6 and 12 months follow-up. The median frequency of painful crises decreased from 5/month to 1/month (p = 0.001). Interestingly, pain recurred within 72 h in two patients, 1 with LM (#6) and 1 with VM (#9), after sirolimus cessation for grade 2 headache and fatigue, respectively, and reduced again rapidly after sirolimus reintroduction. For one patient with extensive lower limb VM (#12), pain disappeared completely after 2 weeks of treatment but reappeared after 6 months despite correct sirolimus blood level and an increased dosage (3 mg/day). After a 2-month therapy-gap, sirolimus reintroduction reduced pain again. Patient #11 (with a limited 2-month-treatment) also experienced pain reduction.\n\nVisual Analogue Scale (continuous pain) results for all patients\nBleeding was a common sign in four patients. It reduced significantly in three patients (#5, #16, #17) and stopped completely in one patient (#9). After a few months, patients #9 and #16 stopped the treatment during 2 weeks due to grade 2 fatigue, and bleeding resurged rapidly (in less than 72 h). Sirolimus reintroduction stopped the bleeding in less than 48 h in both patients.\nInfections and oozing also improved in all patients who frequently experienced them prior to treatment. Median frequency of infections per 6 months decreased from 3 to 1. The four patients with oozing (#4, #8, #17, #18) experienced a rapid reduction in intensity and frequency with sirolimus.\nAfter 1 year of sirolimus treatment, QoL improved in all patients (n = 16/16). Already after 3 months of treatment, moderate (20–50%) or strong (> 50%) QoL improvement was seen in 6 and 10 patients, respectively. This improvement continued at 6 and 12 months time-points for all patients. Patient #12 (see above) who had a strong initial improvement at 3 months, showed a decrease at 6 months due to pain resurgence, despite continuation and a dose-increase of sirolimus. After 2-month treatment arrest and sirolimus reintroduction, QoL improved again. Interestingly, patient #11 who stopped sirolimus after 2 months because of grade 3 mucositis, presented a strong QoL improvement during this period.\nSirolimus decreased coagulation abnormalities. Out of the 11 patients with a venous component, 8 reached 12 months of treatment (all had pre-treatment D-dimer elevations). D-dimer levels decreased in all patients at 3 months and this reduction persisted at 12 months (p = 0.012) (Fig. 4). In two patients (#9, #12), D-dimer levels showed a temporary fluctuation that was correlated with resurgence of symptoms.\n\nD-dimer levels\nAmong the 16 patients radiologically evaluated at 12 months of treatment, T2-MRI-weighted sequences showed a size reduction in 7 of them (43.7%): three LM, one GLA, one VM, one CVM and one KTS. Despite clinical improvement, radiological progression of their malformation was observed in three patients (18.7%): one LM, one GLA and one VM. On ITK-SNAP3–0 evaluation, eight patients (88.9%) showed reduction of their malformation (two LM, one GLA, three VM, one CVM, and one KTS) (Fig. 5). Only patient #13 did not present significant volume reduction (reduction only 0.1 cm3 (0.5%)). None of the nine patients evaluated with the ITK-SNAP segmentation program presented an augmentation of the malformation volume. Seven patients (43.7%) had to be excluded from this quantitative evaluation because of very infiltrative and/or multifocal disease compromising an adequate and reliable contouring of the lesions.\n\nClassical MRI sequences and 3D-volumes of the malformation (patient #15) before initiation of sirolimus (a, c) and after 12 months of treatment (b, d). Notice volume reduction from 14 cm3 to 12,3 cm3\nSafety\nSirolimus was well tolerated (Table 3): headache, skin rash, mucositis, fatigue and diarrhea were the most frequent grade 1–2 adverse events. All were easily manageable with symptomatic treatment or temporary arrest. Three patients stopped sirolimus for a few days due to grade 2 headache (#6) or grade 2 fatigue (#9, #16).\nAdverse events (CTCAE version 3.0)\nMucositis was the most common grade 3 adverse event and led to definitive discontinuation of sirolimus in 2 patients (#10, #11) despite dose adjustment. One 64-year-old patient, with previous history of basal celle carcinomas, had a recurrence of basal cell carcinoma after 1 year of treatment (#9) and was cured by surgical resection without sirolimus interruption. One patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 34 months after treatment initiation (#1). This cancer was considered not to be related to sirolimus medication as it was not an EBV lymphoma.\nDiscussion\nThis prospective phase II study confirms the overall efficacy and safety of sirolimus in patients with refractory-to-standard-care slow-flow vascular malformations. Nineteen patients were included in this trial, representing an important number of these severe cases. All our enrolled patients were highly symptomatic, had a poor QoL and had failed to respond to previous therapies, including surgery, sclerotherapy and various medications. Thus, their lesional areas contained scarred tissues, not only nascent malformation. Yet, sirolimus was clearly efficacious.\nSirolimus was highly effective in VM, LM and combined lesions, and resulted in a partial response in all patients, reducing symptoms and increasing QoL. This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that the majority of patients decided to continue sirolimus treatment even after study end-point due to the significant improvement. Our study also confirmed the reported data that sirolimus does not cure patients with vascular anomalies [22, 25, 26, 31].\nThe efficacy of sirolimus on pain, bleeding and oozing appeared within the first 3 months. Interestingly, the temporary arrest of sirolimus in three patients was associated with a rapid resurgence of pain and/or bleeding, and its reintroduction induced a reversibility. This impressive rapidity of action urges to consider sirolimus in life-threatening vascular malformations. Furthermore, sirolimus allowed interventional procedures that were initially considered unfeasible to be performed in two patients, suggesting that sirolimus could play a role as a pre-treatment before radical and curative interventional procedures of large complicated lesions. As most patients in this study had responded by 6 months, such a pre-treament period could be envisioned. Future clinical trials should be performed to evaluate efficacy of sirolimus on nascent malformations free of scaring.\nSirolimus was well tolerated, both in children and in adults. Adverse events were mostly grade 1 and 2, and easily manageable with symptomatic treatment or temporary arrest. Mucositis was the most common grade 3 adverse event. A young patient presented lymphoma after 34 months of treatment. Despite the fact that it is not possible to completely exclude an indirect role of sirolimus due to its immonusuppressive effect, we considered, after a multidisciplinary discussion, that the lymphoma was not directly caused by the medication since the lymphoma was not of EBV-type. Similarly, a 64-year old patient with a basal cell carcinoma after 1 year of treatment, had a previous history of basal cell carcinomas. Thus, it was not considered to be associated with the sirolimus treatment. Despite absence of direct correlation between sirolimus and these adverse events, follow-up of patients treated with mTOR inhibitor is mandatory and should include an annual dermatological control, and a haematological control (hemogram, liver, thyroid and renal function) every 3–6 months.\nD-dimer level could appear as a potential predictive biomarker for efficacy, since in our study D-dimer levels were associated with sirolimus efficacy and symptomatology. Levels decreased in all of the evaluated patients with a venous component. Furthermore, in two patients (#9, #12) with initial sirolimus efficacy, symptoms reappeared and were associated with a re-increase in D-dimer levels. Further studies should evaluate early evolution of D-dimers in order to identify patients who mostly benefit from mTOR inhibition.\nDespite largely favourable clinical responses, qualitative interpretation of MRI studies routinely used to evaluate clinical progression of vascular malformations, detected regression of lesions only in a minority of patients. The more sensitive ITK-SNAP3–0 evaluation unravelled a slightly higher response rate of a 2-to-34% reduction of malformation volume in 8 out of 9 patients at 12 months. This underscores the use of clinical examination, QoL questionnaire and biomarkers as the best tools to evaluate clinical response.\nOur study is limited by the number of patients enrolled - extensive, refractory-to-standard-care VM, LM and complex vascular lesions are rare - and the heterogeneity of the malformations. Yet, they have a common pathophysiological basis: activation of the PIK3/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, the target of sirolimus treatment. The results of this phase II study underscore the efficacy of sirolimus in these varied lesions.\nFollow-up reached for some patients 48 months. Although too short to confirm long-term efficacy and safety of sirolimus, it gives a basis for such evaluation. As patients experienced clear amelioration of their quality of life, long-term treatment may become a rule. The best tools to measure efficacy thus also seem to be QoL questionnaire and pain with VAS (both with a subjective component). Both may though have confounding effects as many patients have been symptomatic since they were born. Initiation of sirolimus treatment often makes them realize the level of chronic pain they were used to. In patients with a venous component, biomarkers such as D-dimer levels are very helpful to monitor efficacy.\nAll these results are in concordance with our original report on VM and the few reports on LM and/or VM [22, 25, 26, 31]. Notably, Adams and coworkers performed a prospective two-center study with similar response criteria and results [31]. The repeated demonstration of efficacy urges larger phase III trials to be conducted, with enlargement of enrolment criteria.\nConclusion\nOur study confirms that sirolimus is an effective therapeutic option for symptomatic patients with extensive LM, VM and/or complex malformation for which surgery and sclerotherapy do not provide a satisfactory solution. The quality of life is enhanced and pain is reduced.

Evidence of a crucial role for sirolimus in the PI3K/AkT/mTor pathway has stimulated interest in its involvement in neoplasia, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antineoplastic agents. However, in cancer, there is no consensus on sirolimus TDM. In the RAPIRI phase I trial, the combination sirolimus + irinotecan was evaluated as a new treatment for refractory pediatric cancers. Blood sampling at first sirolimus intake (D1) and at steady state (D8), followed by LC/MS2 analysis, was used to develop a population pharmacokinetic model (Monolix® software). A mono-compartmental model with first-order absorption and elimination best fit the data. The only covariate retained for the final model was “body surface area” (D1 and D8). The model also demonstrated that 1.5 mg/m2 would be the recommended sirolimus dose for further studies and that steady-state TDM is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen in atypical profiles (36.4% of the population). No correlation was found between sirolimus trough concentrations and efficacy and/or observed toxicities. The study reveals the relevance of sirolimus TDM in pediatric oncology as it is needed in organ transplantation.\nKeywords: sirolimus, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic drug monitoring, pediatric oncology, Monolix® software, pharmacokinetic population modeling\n1. Introduction\nSirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is a macrolide compound widely used for its immunosuppressive action in organ transplantation, alone or in addition to cyclosporine or tacrolimus [1]. It acts by the inhibition of the mammalian serine–threonine kinase target of rapamycin (m-TOR) protein. This action interrupts mitogenic signaling pathways by inactivating cyclins allowing the transition from G1 to S phase and the synthesis of proteins necessary for cell cycle progression. Sirolimus also plays a key role in lipid and glucose metabolism and regulates Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) production by inhibiting many glycolytic genes, through the inhibition of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) [2]. Evidence of m-TOR’s crucial role in cellular metabolism and PI3K/AkT/m-TOR signaling pathways stimulated interest in its possible involvement in neoplasia. Preclinical studies have shown the antitumor activity of sirolimus either alone [3,4] or in combination with other antitumor drugs [5,6,7,8,9,10]. In clinical trials, synergistic antiangiogenic and pro-apoptotic effects against pediatric tumors have been demonstrated by combining m-TOR inhibitors with vinblastine [11], cyclophosphamide and topotecan [12], cixutumumab [13,14,15], irinotecan and temozolomide [16,17], or celecoxib, and alternating etoposide and cyclophosphamide [18].\nBased on preclinical experiments demonstrating the synergistic effects of sirolimus and irinotecan on the proliferation and metabolism of three tumor cell lines, even at low doses [10], our group tested the combination of daily sirolimus and bimonthly irinotecan administered to pediatric patients (age < 21) with refractory solid tumors in a Phase I trial named RAPIRI (RAPamycin plus IRInotecan) [19]. The aims of the trial were to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this new drug combination, to evaluate the safety and efficacy profiles of each molecule, and at last to determine the doses at which these drugs can be administered.\nSirolimus pharmacokinetics are well known in organ transplantation: its maximum blood concentration occurs 1 to 2 h after oral administration, its bioavailability is low (around 15%), and its effective half-life allows a steady-state concentration to be reached at 5 to 7 days. Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein [20,21]. Therefore, hepatic dysfunction and co-administration of inducers/inhibitors of CYP3A4 or p-glycoprotein influence the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus [22,23].\nIn transplantation, trough concentration is highly correlated with sirolimus exposure, its efficacy, and toxicity [20,21,24]. Therapeutic targets of sirolimus associated with cyclosporine are generally between 5 and 15 µg/L, while trough sirolimus concentrations greater than 15 µg/L are correlated with increased toxicity and less than 5 µg/L with decreased efficacy [21]. However, in cancers, due to the different existing administration regimens and the different types of cancer, there is no clear consensus on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and on the range of trough concentrations to be used.\nHerein, we report a population pharmacokinetics study conducted in the RAPIRI phase I trial, which associated sirolimus (once daily) and irinotecan (every 2 weeks) in pediatric refractory or relapsed solid tumors. The primary objective of our study was to investigate the population pharmacokinetics of sirolimus oral solution administrated after the first dose (with irinotecan) and on day eight (at steady state and without irinotecan) of a 28-day cycle and to assess the impact of different factors on the variability of pharmacokinetic parameters. Our secondary aim was to compare the simulated concentration distributions for each dose level of sirolimus based on its ability to achieve the therapeutic range of 5–15 µg/L used in transplantation therapeutic drug monitoring. Our final endpoint was to compare the trough concentrations of sirolimus of the patients with clinical efficacy or toxicities observed during the trial in order to define the optimal sirolimus starting dose and the therapeutic monitoring strategy relevant for future trials and more generally for therapeutic care using sirolimus as a treatment in pediatric oncology.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Design: Drug Combinations and Administration\nThe RAPIRI phase I trial (national program for clinical research PHRC-N Cancerology 2010, HUS n°4791/n°Eudract: 2010-022329-13, NCT01282697) is a multicenter Phase I clinical trial [19]. Patients from 1 to 21 years old with refractory or relapsed solid tumor after conventional therapies were eligible. All patients or their legal guardians signed a written informed consent prior to inclusion, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and standards of Good Clinical Practice.\nThis phase I trial followed a dose escalation based on a 3 + 3 design with 10 dose levels (Table 1). Sirolimus oral solution of (1 mg/mL) was administered once daily at a dose of 1, 1.5, 2, or 2.5 mg/m2. A 90 min intravenous infusion of irinotecan at 125, 200, or 240 mg/m2 was administered just prior to sirolimus on the first and fifteenth day of each 28-day cycle.\nRAPIRI phase I trial characteristic with the levels, doses of irinotecan and sirolimus, and the number of patients included in each level.\nPatients underwent physical examinations at baseline and every week during the two first courses and every 2 weeks from the third course to the end of the trial. Adverse events were graded from 1 to 4, all along the trial, according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0) [19]. Disease evaluations were performed at baseline and at the end of the second cycle of treatment. Patients had either a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their tumor responses were based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Two independent radiologists reviewed all imaging studies [19].\n2.2. Blood Sampling and Analysis\nSirolimus concentrations were measured after the first intake (D1) and at steady state on day eight (D8). On D1, a blood sample was taken before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 6.5 h after sirolimus oral administration. On D8, seven blood samples were taken before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, and 8 h after sirolimus oral administration.\nAnalyses were performed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography using an Agilent 1200 Series LC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which consists of a binary pump, a vacuum degasser, an autosampler, a thermostatted column compartment and a solid phase extraction (SPE) on-line of the injected sample (50 µL) followed by introduction into the mass spectrometer (Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole).\nThe DOSIMMUNE® kit (Alsachim, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France) was used for the analysis. The kit enables the simultaneous quantification of four immunosuppressant drugs in whole blood (cyclosporin A, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and everolimus). The procedure consisted of deproteinizing a mixture of 25 µL of whole blood and 25 µL of stable labeled internal standards with an extraction reagent. The chromatographic separation was performed with an elution time of 1.3 min. Ammoniated adducts [M+NH4+] of molecules were used as precursor ions for all analytes. In the positive-ion mode, the monitored multiple reaction transitions (m/z) were: Sirolimus 931.7 > 864.5; [13C, 2H3]-Sirolimus 935.5 > 864.5.\nThe method was accredited (Cofrac n°8-3524). The lower limit of quantification was 0.80 µg/L, the upper limit of linearity was 53 µg/L. Intra-assay and inter-assay variations of internal quality controls were inferior to 10%.\n2.3. Compartmental Pharmacokinetic Analysis\nThe pharmacokinetic population model and simulations were performed with the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling Monolix® version 2018R1 (Lixoft SAS, Antony, France) based on the stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM) algorithm. The individual parameters were estimated by the Hastings–Metropolis algorithm. The areas under the curve (AUCs) were secondarily estimated for each patient using the Formula (1).\n\nFor the base model, one- and two-compartment models with first-order absorption and elimination were tested, as well as with saturable elimination processes. Different residual error models were tested (additive, proportional, or combined models). The most appropriate model was select based on the minimum objective function value (OFV), which was the likelihood ratio test in our study. Exponential models described the inter-individual variability (IIV) for the pharmacokinetic parameters.\nA preliminary graphical assessment of the effect of covariates on pharmacokinetic estimates was made. When a relationship emerged, the influence of covariates on the IIV and accuracy parameters was tested. To be retained, a significant variation in OFV was required. A decrease of at least 3.84 (p < 0.05, χ2, 1 degree of freedom) on forward selection and an increase of at least 7.88 (p < 0.005, χ2, 1 degree of freedom) on backward deletion were chosen as criteria for covariates’ selection in order to limit the risk of erroneous conclusions about covariate selection [25]. The inclusion of covariates was guided by clinical plausibility.\nThe continuous covariates were centered on the median and were age, body weight (BW), height, body surface area (BS), body mass index (BMI), and tumor age. The categorical covariates tested were irinotecan dose on day one, sirolimus dose, cotrimoxazole comedication, glucocorticoids comedication, gender, central nervous system (CNS) tumor diagnostic, and age ≥ 12.\nModel evaluation was performed using standard graphs of the correlation between predictions and empirical observations (goodness of fit or GOF), the distribution of weighted residuals (WRES) as a function of time and concentration, and the precision of the pharmacokinetic estimates (residual standard error or RSE). The final model was internally validated based on graphical methods such as distribution of the normalized prediction distribution error (NPDE) and visual predictive checks (VPCs). The VPC graph shows a comparison of the median and the 95% prediction interval for predicted data and the corresponding percentiles for observed data over time.\nBased on multiple simulations (n = 1000) of all the individuals in the dataset, the theoretical distribution of the predictions was set for different doses of sirolimus (1, 1.5, 2, or 2.5 mg/m2).\n2.4. Statistical Analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9® (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Comparisons of different parameters were made using Student’s tests and a p-value of less than 0.05 was required to consider statistical significance.\n3. Results\n3.1. Population Characteristics\nDemographic characteristics and main information on sirolimus administration and comedications are summarized in Table 2. If 42 patients were included in the RAPIRI trial, due to outliers or missing data, only 27 and 34 pharmacokinetic profiles were included in the population analysis on D1 and D8, respectively. All the patients received sirolimus oral solution (1 mg/mL) once daily and an infusion of irinotecan on D1. Eleven patients were on cotrimoxazole on D1 and 15 on D8. Three patients were on glucocorticoids on D1 and D8.\nDemographic characteristics and main information about sirolimus and comedications.\n3.2. Pharmacokinetic Results\nA total of 27 and 34 pharmacokinetics profiles was analyzed on D1 and D8, respectively. There was a high IIV in the collected data, especially on D1. One- and two-compartment models with linear or saturable elimination processes were tested. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination best fit the data. The two-compartment model improved the fit of the data, but significantly decreased the accuracy of the parameters (RSE > 80%) and was ultimately not retained. Based on the lowest OFV, the selected residual error model and the distribution of parameters were proportional and log-normal, respectively. Figure 1 shows the goodness of fit graphs. The population and individual predictions are roughly distributed around the y = x line. The selection of covariates was made on the basis of the pharmacokinetic model.\n\nGoodness of fit plots. Observed concentrations versus population predicted concentrations on day 1 (D1) (a) and day 8 (D8) (c). Observed concentrations versus individual predicted concentrations on D1 (b) and D8 (d). Black line: y = x.\nGraphical relationships emerged between volume of distribution (Vd/F) and allometric covariates such as age, height, BS, and BW on D1 and D8. Thus, the median-normalized BS significantly decreased OFV (ΔOFV = 8.31 on D1 and ΔOFV = 24.81 on D8) and was the only covariate retained on Vd/F (p = 0.0143 and p = 1.69 × 10−5 on D1 and D8, respectively). It decreased Vd/F IIV from 97.6% to 62.5% on D1 and from 69.8% to 30.3% on D8. Between allometric covariates, there was no significant improvement in IIV clearance (Cl/F) on D1. Despite this, on D8, median-normalized BS was selected as continuous covariate on Cl/F (p = 1.03 × 10−4). Once BS was selected as a covariate, no other continuous covariate sufficiently decreased the OFV, on either D1 or D8.\nCategorical covariates such as patient gender, CNS tumor diagnostic, or age ≥ 12 did not show any effect on pharmacokinetic parameters and neither did sirolimus and irinotecan doses. Cotrimoxazole comedication showed an effect on Cl/F on D1 (p = 0.0207) and D8 (p = 0.0079), suggesting that patients on cotrimoxazole had reduced sirolimus clearance (Figure 2). Cotrimoxazole comedication also reduced the clearance IIV by 20.9% and 3.6% on D1 and D8, respectively but did not sufficiently reduce OFV (ΔOFV = 7.13 and ΔOFV = 6.05 on D1 and D8, respectively). Therefore, secondary calculated AUCs were not statistically different on either D1 (p = 0.7394), or D8 (p = 0.2237) (Figure 2). Indeed, there was a trend of lower doses of sirolimus in patients who were on cotrimoxazole (doses on D1 of 1.8 ± 1.0 mg and on D8 of 2.0 ± 1.0, mean ± SD) than in patients without cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (doses on D1 of 2.5 ± 0.6 mg and on D8 of 2.6 ± 0.6, mean ± SD), p = 0.054 on D1 and p = 0.082 on D8. This doses discrepancy could explain the difference of significance observed for the clearance but not the AUC between groups with or without cotrimoxazole.\n\nClearance distribution on D1 (a) and D8 (b) with or without cotrimoxazole comedication. Exposures to sirolimus (predicted AUCs) were not statistically different on either D1 (c) or D8 (d) because of a trend of lower doses of sirolimus in patients who were on cotrimoxazole than in patients without cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. Statistical analysis: Unpaired t test, alpha = 0.05. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ns = no significant differences.\nThe estimation of the base and final models on D1 and D8, the IIV, the residual errors, and the OFV are summarize in Table 3. The selection of covariates improved the accuracy of the parameters and reduced their variabilities on D1 and D8.\nBase and final models estimation on D1 and D8 of sirolimus quantification.\nIIV: interindividual variability; CV: coefficient of variation; OFV: objective function value.\nThe final formulas on D8 for individual parameters Cl/Fi and Vd/Fi are given in Equations (2) and (3), respectively, including individual BS (BSi), median population BS (BS¯), population parameters (θCl/F and θVd/F), and estimated influential factors of the BS (β_Cl_BS and β_Vd_BS).\n\nThe graphs of NPDE vs. time and vs. predicted concentrations showed no trend and were uniformly distributed around the y = 0 line as represented in Figure S1. High variability in sampling time was observed on D1 (Figure S1a) but not on D8 (Figure S1c). VPC plots for sirolimus data on D1 and D8 were used to assess the predictive property of the final model (Figure 3). They showed that the observed concentrations were within in the intervals of predictions. There were some deviations of the observations from the predicted data represented as red circles in Figure 3. These deviations represented 2.5% of the total of the observations and given the relatively small data set and the high variability of the pharmacokinetic profiles, especially on D1, models were considered as acceptable.\n\nVisual predictive check plots of sirolimus observed concentrations (dependent variable DV in µg/L) versus time after the first sirolimus dose (a) and on D8 (b). Blue areas are 95% confidence interval of the 10th and 90th percentiles. The pink area is the confidence interval of the median. Black dotted lines represent means of the 10th, 50th, and 90th predicted percentiles. Blue dots represent observations and green continuous lines represent means of the 10th, 50th, and 90th observed percentiles. Red circles show deviations of the predicted data from the observations.\n3.3. Simulated Concentrations and Therapeutic Range\nFinally, simulated sirolimus concentrations after four different doses (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg/m2) taken once daily for eight days were performed. Given the therapeutic range of trough concentrations of sirolimus at steady state (5–15 µg/L), a search was conducted for the dose of sirolimus that best matched the therapeutic range. The corresponding sirolimus simulations and empirical concentrations on D8 are shown in Figure 4a. While the 1.0 mg/m2 dose led to sub-therapeutic trough concentrations of sirolimus, the 2.0 and 2.5 mg/m2 doses exposed patients to widely variable concentrations (Figure 4c,d), respectively. The 1.5 mg/m2 dose induced adequate steady-state exposure and less variability in sirolimus concentrations (Figure 4b). A percentage of 63.6% of patients receiving this dose had a trough concentration in the therapeutic range on D8, while 36.4% were below the lower limit of the therapeutic range. None of the patients receiving 1.0 mg/m2 reached the 5–15 µg/L range on D8. Of the patients receiving 2.0 and 2.5 mg/m2 of sirolimus per day, 58.3% and 71.4% were within the recommended trough concentration range, respectively. Nevertheless, these dosing regimens induced highly variable pharmacokinetic profiles and overexposed, respectively, 23% and 14% of patients to high sirolimus concentrations for hours, favoring the development of toxicities.\n\nSimulated concentrations versus time after 1.0 mg/m2 (a), 1.5 mg/m2 (b), 2.0 mg/m2 (c), and 2.5 mg/m2 (d) of sirolimus on D8. Dots represent observed concentrations on D8. Simulated concentrations versus time after 1.0 mg/m2 (e), 1.5 mg/m2 (f), 2.0 mg/m2 (g), and 2.5 mg/m2 (h) of sirolimus for 8 days. Dashed lines represent the sirolimus therapeutic range (5–15 µg/L). Solid line represents the median, and the nine green bands represent each 10% percentile of the 90% simulated concentrations distribution.\n3.4. Efficacy and Toxicities’ Assessment after Two Cycles of Treatment\nNo correlation between tumor responses and sirolimus trough concentrations was observed, despite the tendency both for patients with a partial response to have higher sirolimus blood levels and the fact that approximately 67% of patients with progressive disease have sirolimus concentrations below 5 µg/L.\nThe most frequently observed adverse events were vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, oral mucositis, and abdominal pain. Only the maximum grade of toxicity observed was plotted in Figure 5. Nine patients presented grade 3 or 4 toxicities that resolved before the start of cycle 2, and none of these events could be linked to sirolimus-specific toxicities. No significant association was established between sirolimus dose or trough concentrations and toxicity on D8, except for one patient (the red outlier in Figure 5) with a very high concentration of sirolimus on D8 who presented grade 4 adverse events including hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain.\n\nEfficacy and toxicities assessment.

Red dash lines represent sirolimus therapeutic range used in transplantation (5–15 µg/L).\n4. Discussion\nIn this study, we established a population pharmacokinetic model of oral sirolimus for pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumor included in the RAPIRI phase I trial. We defined covariates to reduce OFV, IIV, and RSE of the base model. Moreover, we compare the simulated concentration distributions for each dose level of sirolimus and the sirolimus trough concentrations observed in trial with clinical efficacy and toxicities in order to define the optimal starting dose of sirolimus and to evaluate the relevance of therapeutic drug monitoring strategy for a future phase II trial.\nIn our study, the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus were analyzed using a compartmental pharmacokinetic approach after first intake (D1) and at steady state (D8) in a pediatric population receiving a daily dose of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 mg/m2 and an infusion of irinotecan at 125, 200, or 240 mg/m2 on D1. A mono-compartmental model with first-order absorption and elimination with a proportional residual error model was the best fit for our data. These results confirm previous sirolimus pharmacokinetic studies in pediatric patients with vascular anomalies [26]. Sirolimus pharmacokinetics were also shown to follow a bi-compartmental model in children with recurrent solid tumors [27], but unlike our study, this work was based on rich sampling data on the distribution and the elimination phases [26,28]. As the bioavailability of sirolimus was not assessed in our study, clearance and volume of distribution estimates represent the apparent pharmacokinetic parameters, Cl/F and Vd/F, respectively. On D1, sirolimus was rapidly eliminated (Cl/F = 23.9 L/h), and Vd/F was 88.9 L. On D8, the estimate of sirolimus Cl/F (Cl/F = 11.9 L/h for a BS of 1.3 m2) was consistent with previous studies at steady state in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (11.8 L/h) [29] and complicated vascular anomalies (Cl/F = 18.5 L/h) [26], but higher than in pediatric renal transplant recipients receiving calcineurin inhibitor co-therapy (Cl/F = 4.8 L/h/m2) [30]. High variability in pharmacokinetic parameters was identified in the base model on D1 (IIV = 95.6% (RSE = 19.5%) and IIV = 97.6% (RSE = 24.6%) in Cl/F and Vd/F, respectively) and on D8 (IIV = 71.8% (RSE = 13.4%) and IIV = 69.8% (RSE = 16.0%) in Cl/F and Vd/F, respectively). The final evaluation of the model was conducted using internal tools. The GOF plots showed a rough distribution of observations and predictions around the identity line, with a few patients with atypical profiles and erroneous model predictions. The mean and variance of the NPDE were consistent with a normal distribution (N(0; 1)). Therefore, a high variability in sampling time was observed on day one, which may be due to the fact that children and nurses were not used to restrictive sampling schedules on the first day of the study. Despite highly variable population profiles, the VPC plots illustrated acceptable model prediction capabilities.\nIn order to try to explain parameters’ IIV, the influence of covariates on the pharmacokinetic parameters was studied. On D1, even though allometric covariates such as patient age, height, BS, and BW graphically correlated with Vd/F, the BS was the only one that sufficiently improved the OFV (ΔOFV = 8.31) and was retained for the final model. Its selection explained one-third of the Vd/F IIV on day one. None of the continuous or categorical covariates could explain the high Cl/F IIV on day one. On day eight, the BS selection on Cl/F and Vd/F improved the base model (ΔOFV = 41.23) and decreased the parameters IIV (ΔIIV = 21.7% in Cl/F and ΔIIV = 40.4% in Vd/F). Although age had an effect on clearance on day eight, once BS was retained on the model, the categorical covariate “age ≥ 12” had no effect on the estimate of Cl/F in our population. Goyal et al. showed that weight-normalized Cl/F was three times higher in patients under 12 years of age than in those over 12 years of age in early post myeloablative blood and marrow transplantation, which could be explained by age-dependent variations in enzyme expression and activity [31].\nSirolimus is extensively metabolized by intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 and is also a substrate of the p-glycoprotein efflux pump [22,23,32]. In literature, administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as azoles or diltiazem increases sirolimus trough concentrations [21], as does the co-administration of cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of the p-glycoprotein [33]. In our study, irinotecan, a p-glycoprotein substrate that may compete for p-glycoprotein transport [32,34], was administered during a 90 min infusion in different doses (125, 200, or 240 mg/m2) just prior to sirolimus intake on D1. No effect of irinotecan doses was observed on sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters (p > 0.05). Then, three patients were stabilized on glucocorticoid treatments (one patient on dexamethasone and two patients on hydrocortisone), which are inducers of CYP3A4 gene expression [35], but the effect of this categorical covariate could not be correlated with sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters. However, other studies have shown the same results, suggesting that other etiologies should be explored if sirolimus concentrations change during glucocorticoid treatment [36,37]. Finally, cotrimoxazole is a combination of two antimicrobial agents (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) that act synergistically against a wide variety of bacteria and protozoa and is routinely used as prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. It is known as an in vitro inhibitor of CYP 2C8/2C9 at low concentrations and as an inhibitor of CYP3A4 at high concentrations [38]. Administration of cotrimoxazole prior to sirolimus intake did not influence the maximum whole blood sirolimus concentration or AUC in renal transplant recipients [39]. In our study, 11 patients were on long-term cotrimoxazole on D1, and 15 patients were on D8. The median dose of cotrimoxazole was 400/80 (range from 200/40 to 800/160 mg sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim on D1 and D8), and cotrimoxazole was always administered three times a week. The time elapsed between the last dose of cotrimoxazole and the measurement of sirolimus concentrations was not noted. Cotrimoxazole was analyzed as a categorical covariate and patients on cotrimoxazole had 2.20-fold (p = 0.0207) and 1.71-fold (p = 0.0079) lower Cl/F compared to patients who did not take this prophylaxis on D1 and D8, respectively. Therefore, the selection of this covariate was impossible due to an insufficient drop in OFV. Consistent with the previous study [39], the secondary calculated AUCs were not statistically different between the two groups on either D1 (p = 0.7394) or D8 (p = 0.2237) due to a trend of lower doses of sirolimus in patients on cotrimoxazole. In consequence, despite the decreased clearance of sirolimus, no clinical impact was expected in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors on long-term cotrimoxazole therapy.\nAfter successive daily administrations, steady-state sirolimus concentrations were reached in 5 to 7 days. Zimmerman and Kahan showed that there is an excellent linear correlation between the trough steady-state blood concentration and AUC (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.99, slope = 0.0652, intercept = −0.880), over a dose range of 0.5 to 3.5 mg/m2 twice a day, suggesting that the trough blood concentration could be a relevant estimator of the sirolimus exposure in this dose range [40]. Thus, the trough target sirolimus concentrations are between 5 to 15 µg/L, and they are already used in organ transplantation and could certainly be use in oncology. Based on these guidelines, our study investigated the daily dose of sirolimus (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 mg/m2) that provides sirolimus steady-state concentrations within the recommended range and showed that the 1.5 mg/m2 dose provided the sirolimus concentrations that best met the guidelines with less variability in the concentration profiles. Overall, 63.6% of patients receiving this dose reached the range of 5–15 µg/L on D8. In consistency with our results, other pediatric oncology studies suggested an initial dosing regimen of 1.5 mg/m2 per day or 0.8 mg/m2 twice a day. However, due to the limited percentage of patients reaching the recommended range and the occurrence of reduced efficacy, side effects, or toxicities, therapeutic drug monitoring is necessary 7 to 10 days after sirolimus initiation, in order to adjust the dose. In consequence, the starting daily dose for a future RAPIRI Phase II trial would be 1.5 mg/m2 once a day during a 28-day cycle, and a measurement of the trough steady-state concentration would be necessary on D8 to adjust the sirolimus dose for the outliers of the therapeutic range. Once the adjustment is made, further pre-administration sampling would be required after 1 to 2 weeks until the target range is reached.\n5. Conclusions\nIn order to assess the variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters of sirolimus administered daily, a population pharmacokinetic model was proposed after the first dose and at steady state. Explaining some of the IIV, the median-normalized BS was selected as covariate on Vd/F on day one and on Cl/F and Vd/F on day eight. Despite the decreased sirolimus clearance in patients receiving long-term cotrimoxazole, the sirolimus AUCs were not modified, and no clinical impact of cotrimoxazole administration was expected in routine. The model data also demonstrated that 1.5 mg/m2 would be the recommended dose for a future phase II trial, but therapeutic drug monitoring is necessary at steady state to adjust the sirolimus dosing regimen in atypical patient profiles. Moreover, our study reveals the relevance of sirolimus therapeutic monitoring in pediatric oncology as it is needed in organ transplantation.\nSupplementary Materials\nThe following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics13040470/s1, Figure S1: Diagnostic plots.

The mechanism remains complicated and lacks a standard clinical treatment. Current first-line and second-line medications for ITP have shown limited effectiveness, necessitating the exploration of new therapeutic options. Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that has been demonstrated to inhibit lymphocyte activity, indicating potential for SRL in the treatment of ITP. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sirolimus as a second-line drug in patients with ITP. The starting dose of sirolimus for adults ranged from 2 to 4 mg/day, with a maintenance dose of 1 to 2 mg/day. For children, the starting dose was 1–2 mg/day, with a maintenance dose of 0.5–1 mg/day. The dosage could be adjusted if needed to maintain a specific blood concentration of sirolimus, typically between 5 and 15 ng/ml, throughout the treatment period. After 3 months, the overall response rate was 60% (12/20), with 30% of patients (6/20) achieving a complete response (CR) and 30% (6/20) achieving a partial response (PR). The CR rate at 6 months remained consistent with the 3-month assessment. No major adverse events were reported, indicating that sirolimus was well tolerated and safe. Analysis of peripheral blood Treg cell percentages in both the control and ITP showed no significant difference before treatment. The percentage of Treg cells increased after treatment with sirolimus, suggesting that sirolimus increases Treg cells. These findings suggest that sirolimus serves as an effective second-line treatment option for ITP, demonstrating favorable clinical efficacy.\nKeywords: primary immune thrombocytopenia, sirolimus, treg cells\nIntroduction\nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by idiopathic thrombocytopenia, with an annual prevalence of two to four instances per 100 000 people. Clinical manifestations are mainly skin and mucous membrane bleeding, and in severe cases, there may be internal organs or even intracranial hemorrhage [1]. As the main treatment for ITP, glucocorticoids achieve initial remission in two-thirds of patients, but the relapse rate is high after drug reduction or discontinuation [2]. Second-line therapy also has a variety of practical limitations. So there is a need to find new agents that can sustain platelet levels and provide a viable treatment for patients with recurrent/refractory ITP.\nSirolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that belongs to the class of mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors [3]. It can prevent the formation of platelet antibodies and weaken the immune response [3,4]. It has since been used to treat various immune-mediated disorders, including autoimmune lymphocyte hyperplasia syndrome (ALPS), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), Evans syndrome, and ITP [5–7]. However, the available data on sirolimus's efficacy in these conditions are still limited, and its overall application may be constrained. In addition to sharing the institution's experience with sirolimus in treating ITP, the mentioned study aims to compare the regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in patients before and after sirolimus therapy with those in healthy control groups. This comparison would provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of ITP and the impact of sirolimus treatment on Treg cells.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nAll patients included had been diagnosed with primary ITP and had undergone at least two tests showing a low platelet count, with normal blood cell morphology. Physical examination did not reveal any enlargement of the spleen. The number of megakaryocytes found in the bone marrow was either normal or elevated, indicating a maturation problem. Other potential causes of secondary thrombocytopenia, such as connective tissue disorders, thyroid disorders, lymphatic system proliferative disorders, myelodysplastic disorders (aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome), hematologic malignancies, chronic liver disease, hyperplenism, common immunodeficiency diseases, infections, or drug-induced thrombocytopenia were ruled out.\nThe patients included in the study had been initially treated with glucocorticoids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, which are the typical first-line treatments for ITP. However, they either relapsed or did not respond to these treatments. Some patients had previously received second-line therapies other than mTOR inhibitors, whereas others had not. The age range of the patients varied from 13 to 83 years. Specifically, the study focused on patients who had not responded.\nStudy design\nThis retrospective study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and safety of sirolimus monotherapy in the treatment of primary ITP. Prior to participating in the study, each patient provided written informed consent and agreed to be managed by the approved physicians for the trial and follow-up.\nThe patients were monitored at various time points, including before starting the medication, at 1, 2, and 3 weeks, and at 1, 2, and 3 months after starting treatment. Regular assessments of blood lipids, kidney function, and liver function were conducted every 2 weeks. The proportion of regulatory T (Treg) cells was measured using flow cytometry before starting medication and at 3 months after initiation of treatment. All laboratory assays were performed by the same laboratory within the same institution.\nData on the patients’ gender, age, and immunologic features were gathered concurrently. Before the study was conducted, it received approval from the Ethics Committee of the unit (YQ/012023/01) and adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.\nTreatment\nThe starting dose of sirolimus for adults ranged from 2 to 4 mg/day, with a maintenance dose of 1–2 mg/day. For children, the starting dose was 1–2 mg/day, with a maintenance dose of 0.5–1 mg/day. The dosage could be adjusted if needed to maintain a specific blood concentration of sirolimus, typically between 5 and 15 ng/ml, throughout the treatment period.\nThe blood concentration of sirolimus was monitored after 1 week of treatment, 1 month, or whenever significant side effects were observed. This was done to ensure the drug was within the therapeutic range and make any necessary dosage adjustments.\nTo maintain consistent bioavailability, patients were usually instructed to take sirolimus at fixed times, either with or without food. It was also important to avoid consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice during dosing as it can interfere with the drug's metabolism.\nAll patients included in the study were required to continue taking sirolimus for a minimum of 3 months, provided they were tolerating the drug well. If no improvements were observed after 3 months, the drug was gradually discontinued. Patients who showed a response to sirolimus continued the treatment for more than 6 months to 1 year.\nEvaluation of response\nThe evaluation criteria used in this study, based on the ITP International Working Group standard, are as follows: complete response (CR) represents a platelet count (PLT) higher than 100 × 109/l without bleeding after treatment; response (R) signifies a PLT exceeding 30 × 109/l and at least two times the baseline count without bleeding; no response (NR) indicates a PLT below 30 × 109/l, an increase of less than twice the baseline count, or the presence of bleeding after treatment. Relapse is defined by a drop in platelet counts or the return of bleeding symptoms in patients with CR or R. Overall response (OR) encompasses both CR and R. The time from treatment initiation to CR or R is considered the response time, and sufficient platelet count tests must be conducted for defining CR or R. Recurrence is determined by at least two tests with a minimum of 1-day interval in between.\nToxicity monitoring\nThe evaluation criteria refer to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)5.0, published by the American Cancer Society. Patients with severe adverse reactions should be withdrawn from the study immediately and given appropriate treatment. After treatment, all patients were followed up for 1 month for safety, whether effective or not.\nExamination of regulatory T cells\nTreg cells were detected using flow cytometry to measure the percentage of CD4+CD25highCD127low/CD4+T cells. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and 3 months after sirolimus treatment.\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS 25.0 statistical software was used for data analysis. Shapiro–Wilk test was used to check whether the data met the normal distribution. The mean value of measurement data conforming to the normal distribution was expressed as mean ± SD, whereas the mean value of disobedience was expressed as median, and the count data was expressed as a percentage. Univariate ANOVA analysis of variance was used to compare the differences between groups for measurement data conforming to normal distribution; Friedman nonparametric test was used for multiple relevant samples for data disconforming to normal distribution or uneven variance, and P less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The risk factors influencing the curative effect were analyzed by binary logistic regression.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nA total of 20 patients diagnosed with ITP were included in this study, with 6 men and 14 women. The median age of the patients was 51 years, ranging from 13 to 83 years. Among them, 2 patients were children, aged 13 and 14 years. All patients initially received glucocorticoid therapy upon diagnosis, with an early treatment effectiveness rate of 60%. Out of the total, three cases (15%) were administered IVIG at the onset of the disease. For patients who did not respond to or relapsed after hormonal therapy, alternative treatments were used: four cases (20%) were given cyclosporine A, five cases (25%) received TPO-RAs (thrombopoietin receptor agonists), four cases (20%) were treated with eltrombopag, two cases (10%) received azathioprine, and three cases (15%) utilized traditional Chinese medicine. However, these treatments showed poor efficacy or failed to maintain stable platelet counts. The median time from diagnosis to sirolimus initiation for all enrolled patients was 18.5 months, ranging from 1.5 to 294 months. Prior to commencing sirolimus treatment, all patients had discontinued their previous second-line treatment regimen for at least 1 month. In six patients, hormone reduction was in progress during sirolimus introduction. Rapid hormone reduction was achieved within 4–6 weeks of sirolimus application, followed by maintenance treatment with sirolimus alone (Table 1).\nClinical characteristics of immune thrombocytopenia patients\nn = 20.\nEfficacy\nAfter 3 months of sirolimus treatment, 6 out of 20 ITP patients (30%) achieved a CR, whereas another 6 patients (30%) achieved a response (R), resulting in an overall effective rate of 60% (12/20). These 12 patients continued to receive sirolimus and were regularly monitored during follow-up. Patients who did not experience any relief from sirolimus gradually stopped using the medication and were withdrawn from clinical observation.\nThe median response time for the 12 patients who responded to treatment was 2 weeks, ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. Patients who achieved a CR maintained a stable curative effect after 6 months of medication. Among the patients with an initial response (R), two patients experienced disease recurrence after 6 months of medication and eventually discontinued sirolimus because of a lack of significant improvement. However, according to the previous efficacy evaluation criteria, one out of the remaining four patients still demonstrated an R response as their platelet counts measured 100 × 109/l at 4 months, 97 × 109/l at 5 months, and 99 × 109/l at 6 months.\nDuring the follow-up period, the median duration of sirolimus use for these patients was 17 months, ranging from 8 to 36 months. Sirolimus therapy was interrupted in one patient because of disease recurrence at 8 months of treatment, whereas the CR/R patients maintained stable platelet counts (Tables 2 and 3 and Figs. 1 and 2)\nEfficacy evaluation of immune thrombocytopenia patients treated with sirolimus\nCR indicates complete response; R, response; NR, no response.\nP < 0.05 was considered significant (analyzed by Fisher's exact test).\nChanges of platelet values in immune thrombocytopenia patients treated with sirolimus\nData are presented as median.\nP < 0.05 was considered significant (analyzed by nonparametric test).\n\nPlatelet values of 20 patients with immune thrombocytopenia treated with sirolimus.\n\nChanges of platelet levels in immune thrombocytopenia patients during sirolimus treatment.\nIn order to assess the true efficacy of sirolimus treatment for ITP, we analyzed the impact of various factors including gender, age, duration of diagnosis, and initial platelet count on treatment effectiveness. However, our analysis revealed that none of these factors were found to be associated with the efficacy of sirolimus treatment. This suggests that sirolimus may be effective regardless of these demographic and clinical variables in treating ITP. Further studies may be needed to explore other potential factors that could influence the response to sirolimus therapy in ITP patients (Table 4).\nCorrelation analysis of factors affecting the efficacy of sirolimus\nOR, overall response; PLT, platelet count.\nChanges in Treg cell levels before and after treatment\nTo assess the impact of sirolimus treatment on Treg levels in ITP patients, we compared the proportion of Treg cells before and after 3 months of sirolimus therapy in 20 ITP patients, as well as in a control group of 20 healthy individuals.\nBefore therapy, the proportion of Treg cells in the ITP patients was not significantly different from that of the normal control group (P = 0.648), as determined by a single-factor ANOVA test. However, after medication, there was a significant difference in the proportion of Treg cells compared with the normal control group (P = 0.004). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the proportion of Treg cells before and after sirolimus treatment (P = 0.067).\nThese results indicate that sirolimus treatment, when combined with the rank mean, significantly enhanced the proportion of Treg cells in all three states. The increase in Treg cells induced by sirolimus may contribute to the treatment of ITP (Table 5).\nTreg/CD4+ T-cell levels in normal subjects and immune thrombocytopenia patients before and after treatment\nData are presented as mean ± SD.\nP < 0.05 was considered significant (analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA).\nToxicity/safety\nAll patients in the study received sirolimus treatment without experiencing any grade 3 or higher adverse effects. Adverse reactions that occurred were generally mild and included acne in one instance, diarrhea in two cases, rash in two cases, and increased transaminase in one case. These adverse reactions were effectively managed through drug dose reduction or symptomatic therapy, and they resolved over time. It is worth noting that the adverse reactions typically occurred 3 months after starting the medication.\nDuring the course of treatment, none of the patients reported any discomfort, and treatment was not discontinued because negative drug effects. Additionally, not all patients experienced oral ulcers, elevated bilirubin levels, raised blood lipids, infections, or joint pain.\nThe blood concentration of sirolimus was initially higher than 15 ng/ml in two patients (27.7 and 19.5 ng/ml, respectively). However, after reducing the dosage, the blood concentration returned to the normal range. The remaining patients maintained a steady drug concentration, and there were no changes in the drug dosage because of concerns about drug concentration throughout the treatment period.\nDiscussion\nOver the past decade, the field of ITP research has witnessed rapid advancements, leading to the emergence of new therapeutic agents and clinical trial findings. Glucocorticoids are commonly used as the first-line treatment for ITP, but their long-term efficacy is limited, with high relapse rates and various side effects such as osteoporosis and high blood pressure [2]. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used in emergencies or when platelet count decreases significantly, but its effects are short-lived [8]. Rituximab, recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO), heteromethylated nucleic acid (hetrombopag), and eltrombopag are considered second-line or third-line therapies for ITP, but their efficacy varies and they come with certain limitations such as an increased risk of infection or the need for limited duration of use [9,10].\nIn this context, our center conducted a single-center study since January 2020 with the aim of exploring the clinical efficacy of sirolimus in the treatment of ITP. Sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has been found to restore immune homeostasis by inhibiting the differentiation of T lymphocytes into pro-inflammatory cells, such as Th17 and Th1 cells, thereby inhibiting platelet antibody production and reducing immune response. Additionally, sirolimus promotes the differentiation of functional regulatory T cells (Tregs), which play a crucial role in maintaining immune balance [3,4]. Our study results revealed that sirolimus demonstrated a beneficial effect in a subset of ITP patients, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% at 1 month and 60% at 3 months, consistent with previous findings [11,12]. Although the 3-month ORR observed in our study was lower compared with a study by Feng et al.[3], which reported an ORR of 85% for sirolimus treatment in ITP, it should be noted that their study included a larger sample size. Further research is warranted to confirm and elucidate the efficacy of sirolimus in the management of ITP. Notably, the majority of international sirolimus treatments for ITP are focused on pediatric patients, and our study had a limited sample size of only adults, with comparable ORRs observed at 3 months (56%) and 6 months (44%) to those reported in pediatric studies [4,6,7].\nSirolimus demonstrated favorable clinical efficacy and was well tolerated in our study, with adverse effects such as generalized rash, facial acne, diarrhea, elevated transaminases, and hyperlipidemia being transient and resolving spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment. Importantly, sirolimus is considered a safer alternative to other second-line therapies and is suitable for long-term use because of its immunosuppressive effects and potential upregulation of Tregs.\nDespite these promising findings, our study had limitations. Some patients in our study were receiving glucocorticoid adjuvant therapy concurrently with sirolimus, which may have influenced the early efficacy statistics. Additionally, the limited number of ITP cases restricted our ability to perform correlation analysis and predict long-term clinical outcomes with a larger sample size. Future research should aim to address these limitations and provide further insights into the clinical use of sirolimus in ITP management.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, sirolimus holds promise as an effective and well tolerated treatment option for ITP. Its immunosuppressive properties and potential modulation of Tregs make it a valuable second-line therapy, especially for patients who do not respond well to glucocorticoids or other standard treatments. Future studies with larger sample sizes and comprehensive correlation analyses are needed to validate and expand upon our findings.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Third People's Hospital of Datong.\nWe acknowledge all the workers involved in study searching, data extraction, statistical analysis and writing.\nFunding: this work was supported by Key Research and development Project of Datong (Grant Number 2020064).\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\nArticles from Blood Coagulation & Fibrinolysis are provided here courtesy of Wolters Kluwer Health\nACTIONS\nPERMALINK\nRESOURCES\n\n\n                            Similar articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                             Cited by other articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                                 Links to NCBI Databases\n                            \n\nCite\nAdd to Collections\n\n                            Connect with NLM\n                        \n\nNational Library of Medicine\n             8600 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20894\n\n",

Molecular investigations into the underlying mechanisms of VAs have unveiled the frequent involvement of the PI3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Sirolimus, a specific mTOR inhibitor, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent; however, its routine clinical application in complex VAs is currently restricted by a lack of extensive clinical experience.\nMethods\nBetween 2015 and 2024, we administered sirolimus to 14 pediatric patients with various types of vascular anomalies in two Italian centers, subjecting them to clinical and instrumental follow-up to investigate its efficacy and the possible occurrence of adverse events.\nResults\nAn overall improvement in or stability of their vascular anomalies was reported by 86% of patients. We also assessed toxicity, noting a low prevalence of life-threatening adverse events: only one case of sepsis was reported in a patient with a severe clinical condition, and four cases of recurrent aphthosis (28%) were reported. The most common side effect was dyslipidemia, with 43% of patients developing hypercholesterolemia (21%) or hypertriglyceridemia (21%), although these patients generally did not reach severe levels.\nDiscussion\nIn line with data in the literature, according to our experience, medical therapy with sirolimus should be considered in pediatric patients affected by vascular anomalies.\nKeywords: sirolimus, vascular anomalies, safety, mTOR, PIK3CA\n1. Introduction\nVascular anomalies (VAs) represent a spectrum of rare diseases classified into vascular tumors and malformations (1). This category includes vascular tumors characterized by endothelial cell proliferation and vascular malformations exhibiting mesenchymal and angiogenetic disorders. VAs are inherently congenital, persisting even when asymptomatic, and do not regress spontaneously. These malformations can be categorized based on a single vessel type, combined vascular components, or association with other non-vascular anomalies (2).\nClinical management of VAs requires a multidisciplinary approach involving different specialists for both diagnosis and therapy. Symptoms may vary depending on the type of VA and its location but generally include disfigurement, pain, infections, and coagulopathies involving both thrombotic and hemorrhagic aspects, potentially leading to organ dysfunction and, in severe cases, death (3, 4). In some cases of VAs, primarily kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, the Kasabach–Merritt phenomenon can occur, characterized by a life-threatening thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy (5).\nRecent advancements in understanding VAs have emphasized the identification of common DNA variants, mostly somatic, implicated in their pathogenesis. Key pathways contributing to the genesis of vascular anomalies include the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, the angiopoietin–TIE2 pathway, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These proteins play crucial roles in endothelial cellular growth, apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, and the regulation of signaling and angiogenesis (4, 6, 7).\nThe recent understanding of the molecular basis of VAs suggested the increasing use of targeted therapies to inhibit overactive signaling pathways. Among the precision medicine approaches, sirolimus has been often used in treating VAs, and the medical literature, mostly focused on adult patients, has reported encouraging results so far, both in terms of clinical response and treatment tolerability.\nThe first studies reported an efficacy of oral sirolimus in treating VAs of nearly 80% (1, 8, 9) with a low rate of side effects. However, its employment as a topical medication remains controversial (3). Subsequent studies on sirolimus extended to pediatric patients with VAs reported comparable results, highlighting its positive effect, particularly on lymphatic and combined malformations (10–12).\nSide effects reported in the literature are generally not severe and include mucositis in approximately 30% of patients, mild gastrointestinal symptoms, and dyslipidemia less frequently (10, 13). An increased susceptibility to infections is also described, although these infections are generally not severe nor life-threatening (14).\nIn general, the off-label use of sirolimus in children for VAs requires further investigation: the aim of this study is to contribute by providing further insight into this subject matter by reporting our experience and analyzing our case series of patients.\n2. Materials and methods\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 14 pediatric patients who were under our care between 2015 and 2024 at the Pediatric Onco-Hematology Department of the Regina Margherita Children’s Hospital in Turin and the Division of Pediatrics of the Hospital Maggiore in Novara, Italy.\nAs sirolimus is employed off-label for treating VAs in childhood, its use was reserved for a few eligible patients. We included patients for whom a surgical approach proved impossible, ineffective, or difficult; those whose VAs highly impacted their quality of life due to pain or functional impairment; and those at risk of functional damage to an organ due to the growth of VAs. All included patients were between 0 and 20 years of age and able to take oral therapy. The exclusion criteria were refusal to participate in the study, pre-existing toxicity that prevented patients from taking sirolimus, inability or unreliability in taking oral therapy, the possibility of subjecting the patient to satisfactory surgery, and mild VAs without impairment of organ function or quality of life.\nEight patients (57%) were characterized at a molecular level by molecular analysis on bioptic VA samples to investigate mosaic and germline genetic variants in genes coding for proteins involved in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK/MEK pathways and genes of the vascular proliferation pathways. Three different custom next generation sequencing (NGS) panels were used including PIK3R1, PIK3R2, PIK3CA, PTEN, PDK1, PDK2, KRAS, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, RICTOR, MAPKAP1, MLST8, MTOR, IRS1, GAB1, GAB2, THEM4, MAPK8I1, PTPN11, RAPTOR, RASA1, TEK, TSC2, GNAQ, TSC1, DEPDC5, CCND2, NPRL3, GNA11, A2ML1, BRAF, CBL, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, NF1, NRAS, PTPN11, RAF1, RT1, SHOC2, SOS1, SPRED1, CCND2, GNA11, and RASA1 (15). Treatment approval from the Local Drug and Pharmacy Committee was obtained. This study received approval from the institutional review board (IRB) (No. 68301) on 17 June 2022 and was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all the individual participants included in the study and their parents.\nThe mean age at the start of treatment was 7.0 years ± 5.7 (range 0.7–19.3 years), and the average follow-up time was 37.9 months ± 22.9, with a range of 10–93 months.\nOur patient group exhibited heterogeneity, encompassing\n\nfive lymphatic malformations (three localized, two diffused),\ntwo venous malformations,\nfour vascular tumors (two hemangioendotheliomas, one angioblastoma, one angiofibroma), and\nthree combined VAs (one arteriovenous, two Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome cases).\nExcept for two patients who received sirolimus once a day, all the others received the therapy twice a day. In accordance with Società Italiana per lo Studio delle Anomalie Vascolari (SISAV) guidelines for VAs (16), we commenced sirolimus at a dosage of 0.8 mg/m2 per administration. The optimal sirolimus blood concentration varies in the literature, but the most frequently used concentrations in pediatric patients are 5–15 and 10–15 ng/ml (3, 12). Therefore, the dose was adjusted to achieve a target maintenance sirolimus blood concentration between 5 and 15 ng/ml. Treatment was also adjusted based on side effects and suspended in case of fever (body temperature >37.5°). All patients received prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Evaluation of the treatment response was based on both imaging techniques [Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or ultrasound (US)] and clinical findings, including patient-reported complaints related to pain, bleeding/oozing, and clinical assessment of VA swelling. The patients underwent systematic clinical and hematological follow-ups and imaging assessments (MRI and/or US) to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy and monitor related adverse events. Adverse events were categorized and graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0) (17). Data are available in online Mendeley repository https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hsdwx9d6d4/1.\n3. Results\nThe characteristics of all the patients are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1.\nPatients’ features and response to treatment.\nSAE, side adverse event; M, male; F, female; Hypertrig, hypertriglyceridemia; hypercol, hypercholesterolemia; g, grade; +, improvement; =, stability; −, worsening; NA, not applicable; ND, no data; Neg, negative.\nThe mean duration of sirolimus therapy was 24.8 months ±10.5 (range 4–37 months), and currently, 7 out of the 14 patients are still undergoing therapy (50%). Among these, in three patients (21%), it was difficult to maintain appropriate blood levels of sirolimus due to the onset of side effects for which we could not increase the dosage, while three patients (21%) showed values fluctuating around the lower limit. At the end of the observation period, 12 out of 14 patients (86%) are alive, while 2 (14%) have deceased.\nIn 13 patients (93%), we attempted an ineffective invasive approach or local treatment before initiating medical therapy.\nCurrently, seven patients (50%; cases 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, and 14) are under treatment. Two patients (14%; cases 9 and 10) discontinued the therapy due to inefficacy, two patients (14%; cases 4 and 8) discontinued the therapy to start another tailored drug following molecular tests results, one patient (7%; case 7) decided to withdraw his informed consent, one patient (7%; case 13) interrupted treatment for medical reasons (stable lesion), and one (7%; case 11) discontinued because of multiple concomitant adverse events, probably related to the treatment.\nOut of 14 patients, 8 (57%) underwent molecular investigations, with positive results in 5 cases. Pathogenic variants were found in TEK gene (p.Leu914Phe in case 6, p.Thr1106Glufs*6 in case 12) coding for protein TIE2 and in PIK3CA gene (p.Arg108His in case 4, p.Gln546Lys in case 8, and p.Glu542Lys in case 11) coding for PI3K.\n3.1. Efficacy\nAs shown above, 12 patients (86%) reported an overall improvement or stability of their VAs, with 11 cases (78%; cases 1–6, 8, 11–14) showing improvement in symptoms, swelling, and/or imaging findings, while one case (7%; case 7) remaining stable. On the other hand, sirolimus failed to induce an improvement in two patients (14%; cases 9 and 10), both with a severe syndromic condition and visceral involvement, resulting in death due to disease progression.\nOf the 12 patients responding to treatment, effectiveness was proved by imaging in six cases (43%; by MRI in cases 1, 3, 4, and 13 and by US in cases 12, 13, and 14), obtaining a reduction in the size of VAs. Case 11 reported a worsening after discontinuation of sirolimus, despite an improvement in the clinical picture during therapy.\nTreatment efficacy in reducing symptoms was documented in 11 cases (78%): cases 2, 6, and 8 reported reduced pain; case 1 experienced a disappearance of headaches; and cases 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, and 14 exhibited an improvement in swelling or cutaneous involvement. Case 11 reported fewer bleeding episodes, and case 12 noted the end of thrombotic episodes.\nUpon stratifying our cases, all patients (100%) with combined or venous vascular anomalies demonstrated improvement under treatment, whereas patients with vascular tumors showed improvement in three out of four (75%) and substantial stability in one case (case 7). All three cases (100%) of localized lymphatic malformations responded to treatment, while the only notable therapeutic failure occurred in two patients with diffuse lymphatic malformations with visceral involvement, where organ functionality was seriously impaired before initiating sirolimus therapy.\nOf the three patients in whom we encountered difficulties in maintaining sirolimus within the target blood range (21%; cases 2, 5, and 11), one discontinued the drug intake due to adverse events (case 11), while the other two continued as drug withdrawal resulted in a rapid worsening of symptoms.\nAll patients (100%) with a mutation for genes coding for proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway reported a clinical response after initiation of sirolimus therapy.\n3.2. Safety\nAs concerns safety, we reported only one major infectious event (sepsis with pelvic hemorrhage) in patient 10; this was an isolated episode occurring in a child with a very complex clinical picture. Dyslipidemia was the most common adverse event (46%), with three cases (21%) of hypertriglyceridemia (two of grade 2 and one of grade 1) and three cases (21%) of hypercholesterolemia (two of grade 2 and one grade 1). The second most common side effect was recurrent aphthosis (four patients; 28%), but it was not severe in all cases. In addition, we observed two cases (14%) of reversible Bell's palsy and two patients (14%) with a recurrence of warts. In our cohort, we treated aphthosis with local antiseptic therapy, grade 1 dyslipidemia with diet, and grade 2 dyslipidemia with omega-3. During sepsis in patient 10, we suspended administration of sirolimus, while in patient 11, who showed multiple side effects simultaneously, we progressively reduced the dose administered until discontinuation.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Efficacy\nWe report here a case series of children with VAs treated with sirolimus. Our results are encouraging and consistent with those of earlier scientific studies on 57 and 41 patients of all ages (1, 9), reporting success rates of 85% and 80%, respectively. The results also align with the findings of Ji et al. (10), who observed a 77.8% response to sirolimus in 126 pediatric patients after 12 months, and with the results of Zhou et al. (18), who reported a 92.2% response to sirolimus in 154 patients with kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.\nCompared to previous data in the literature, we observed differences in response rates among the different subtypes of VAs: improvement or stability was observed in all patients with venous, lymphatic (localized), combined malformations and vascular tumors, while previous studies found differences in response rates among the various subgroups of VAs. In fact, the study by Ji et al. (10) reported responses mainly in lymphatic, venous, venolymphatic malformations and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, while Maruani et al. (11) reported responses in terms of both symptom regression and volume reduction in lymphatic malformations, only in symptoms in cases of combined malformations, and poor responses in venous malformations.\nThe response to sirolimus in our case series was poor only in cases with visceral lymphatic malformations, but it includes two patients with very severe organ function impairment at the initiation of therapy. Except for these two patients in whom we did not obtain satisfactory results, the others showed positive outcomes regardless of the type of VA. In addition, we observed that, regardless of the type of VA, the best results in terms of symptom reduction and imaging were achieved in patients who started sirolimus at a younger age. This is likely due to the arrest of the anomaly's growth during the patient's growth phase, where the malformation remains stable as the patient continues to grow.\n4.2. Safety\nOur data concerning the side effects of sirolimus reflect those in the literature, although we evidenced a slightly lower incidence of oral mucositis than the expected rate. The review by Zhang et al. (13), which includes nine studies involving 575 pediatric patients receiving sirolimus, indicated a 20.52% occurrence of mucositis considering all the therapeutic indications, with a prevalence of 33.9% in patients with VAs, while the study by Ji et al. (10) reported a 37.0% occurrence. Conversely, we observed a higher rate of patients developing dyslipidemia (43%) compared to that has been reported in the literature. Zhang et al. (13), in fact, reported dyslipidemia in only 6.26% of cases. Only in one situation did adverse events lead us to stop the treatment, primarily due to the concomitance of side events rather than their severity (case 11).\nIn our patient group, we did not report infections due to Pneumocystis carinii, but it is to note that all patients took trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as this infection has been described during sirolimus treatment, especially without prophylaxis (19).\nFinally, it is also important to note that we found a high rate of patients positive for specific variants within the several cellular pathways investigated; such cases might deserve targeted treatment, and therefore, we recommend that patients with VAs must undergo genetic testing for somatic variants as soon as possible.\n4.3. Molecular findings\nIn our sample, as described above, we performed molecular investigations and found five pathogenic variants (two in TEK/TIE2 and three in PIK3CA gene). Literature data suggest somatic mutations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway primarily in patients with lymphatic and venous VAs and in those with syndromic conditions (Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome, congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevi and scoliosis/skeletal/spinal anomalies (CLOVES) syndrome, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, etc.) (4). The patients we described, in whom we found mutations in genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, reflect the literature in three cases (two of Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome and one of venous malformation), while one case of arteriovenous malformation and one case of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma showed mutations in TEK and PIK3CA genes, respectively. However, arteriovenous malformations and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma are described as being mainly associated with somatic mutations in the RAS/MAPK/MEK pathway (4).\n4.4. Conclusions\nConsidering the good response rate with the restrained occurrence of tolerable toxicity, we can cautiously assert that sirolimus therapy should be considered in pediatric patients with VAs. Nevertheless, while side events are relatively few, they are not negligible. Clinicians should carefully consider the risk–benefit ratio at the initiation of therapy, determining which cases of VAs may benefit from sirolimus.\nThis series has obvious limitations, mostly regarding the retrospective nature of the study and the limited number of observations. Although our data, in conjunction with previous literature, support the use of sirolimus for VAs, further studies with larger samples and higher quality are necessary to enhance our understanding of this drug.\nFunding Statement\nThe authors declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nData availability statement\nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

These lesions are classified as cystic lymphatic malformation (macrocystic, microcystic or mixed), generalized lymphatic anomaly, and Gorham–Stout disease. LAs occur mainly in childhood, and present with various symptoms including chronic airway problems, recurrent infection, and organ disorders. Individuals with LAs often experience progressively worsening symptoms with a deteriorating quality of life. Although limited treatment options are available, their efficacy has not been validated in prospective clinical trials, and are usually based on case reports. Thus, there are no validated standards of care for these patients because of the lack of prospective clinical trials.\nMethods\nThis open-label, single-arm, multicenter, prospective study will assess the efficacy and safety of a mammalian target of the rapamycin inhibitor sirolimus in the treatment of intractable LAs. Participants will receive oral sirolimus once a day for 52 weeks. The dose is adjusted so that the nadir concentration remains within 5–15 ng/ml. The primary endpoint is the response rate of radiological volumetric change of the target lesion confirmed by central review at 52 weeks after treatment. The secondary endpoints are the response rates at 12 and 24 weeks, respiratory function, pleural effusion, ascites, blood coagulation parameters, bleeding, pain, quality of life, activities of daily living, adverse events, side effects, laboratory examinations, vital signs, and pharmacokinetic data.\nResults\nThis is among the first multicenter studies to evaluate sirolimus treatment for intractable LAs, and few studies to date have focused on the standard assessment of the efficacy for LAs treatment. Our protocol uses novel, uncomplicated methods for radiological assessment, with reference to the results of our previous retrospective survey and historical control data from the literature.\nConclusions\nWe propose a multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus for intractable LAs (SILA study; trial registration UMIN000028905). Our results will provide pivotal data to support the approval of sirolimus for the treatment of intractable LAs.\nKeywords: Lymphatic abnormalities, Lymphatic malformation, Generalized lymphatic anomaly, Gorham–Stout disease, Mammalian target of rapamycin\nAbbreviations: LAs, lymphatic anomalies; LM, lymphatic malformation; GLA, generalized lymphatic anomaly; GSD, Gorham–Stout Disease; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; QOL, quality of life; ADL, activities of daily living; BSA, body surface area; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; DICOM, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine; ROI, region of interest; FACT-G, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General\nHighlights\nThis is among the first multicenter studies to evaluate sirolimus for intractable LAs.\nThe study design is useful for evaluating sirolimus treatment in LAs.\nOur study protocol uses novel, uncomplicated methods of radiological assessment.\n1. Introduction\nLymphatic anomalies (LAs) represent a group of diseases involving systemic dysplasia of the lymphatic vessels. Refractory and fatal diseases, termed intractable LAs, can also occur. Cystic lymphatic malformation (LM) also called as lymphangioma, generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA) also called as lymphangiomatosis, and Gorham–Stout Disease (GSD) are representative of these disorders [1]. Classification of LAs was performed by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (Table 1) [2].\nTable 1.\nClassification of lymphatic malformations.\nCystic LMs present at birth in up to 60% of LA cases, and by 2 years of age in approximately 90% [3]. They can be characterized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed cystic lesion. The pathology of cystic LMs is quite variable, ranging from a focal area with minimal swelling to large areas of diffusely infiltrating aberrant lymphatic channels. Depending on their location and extent of the lesion, LMs can affect vital physiological functions. For example, up to 75% of LMs are found in the cervicofacial region, which can cause chronic airway problems, recurrent infection, and functional issues related to speech, oral hygiene, and malocclusion. Treatment of LMs includes observation, surgical excision, sclerotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. Surgical resection and sclerotherapy are usually effective for treating and resolving macrocystic LMs. However, microcystic LMs are more infiltrative and difficult to treat. Interferon, corticosteroids, and propranolol are also used for treatment of inoperable LM, although their effects are limited as they are not indicated for this disease [3].\nGLA is characterized by diffuse or multicentric proliferation of dilated lymphatic vessels resembling common LM [4]. GLA has a variable presentation and can affect several different sites including bone, liver, spleen, mediastinum, lungs, and soft tissues. Thoracic involvement may be associated with poor prognosis compared with cases with soft tissue or bone involvement [4]. GSD is a rare disease characterized by osteolysis in bony segments, with localized proliferation of lymphatic or vascular channels in areas adjacent to the affected bone [5]. While GSD mainly involves the skeletal system, it can also involve the viscera, and clinical findings of GSD and GLA closely overlap. In patients with multifocal lesions, therapeutic options are palliative, and therapy is often aimed at reducing symptoms associated with bone lesions and chylous effusions. For inoperable and intractable cases, corticosteroids, interferon, propranolol, and chemotherapy agents (vincristine) are used, although these treatment approaches are associated with limited responses and significant side effects [4].\nSirolimus is an immunosuppresive agent that inhibits the action of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates cell division, multiplication, and survival [6]. Sirolimus was approved for use to ‘prevent organ rejection reaction in kidney transplant patients’ in the United States in September 1999 and in the European Union in March 2001. As of September 2011, it had been used in 89 countries (although it is not approved for use in Japan) under the product name ‘Rapamune’. In Japan, sirolimus was developed to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and in October 2013, Nobelpharma applied for manufacturing and marketing approval for use of sirolimus in lymphangioleiomyomatosis, which was approved in July 2014.\nRecent studies have found a role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway in the development of blood vessels and lymphatic vascular tissues, and new therapeutic agents that target this pathway are under development [6], [7]. The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus has also been shown to inhibit lymphangiogenesis, and is thought to act on lymphatic tissues within lesions to regulate the production and leakage of lymph by decreasing lymphatic endothelial cell activity. Thus, we hypothesized that treatment with sirolimus will reduce volume of lymphatic tissues and improve the clinical symptoms of patients with LAs. Thus, we have proposed a multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus for intractable lymphatic anomalies (SILA study). Herein, we present the SILA study protocol.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Study objectives\nThe primary objective of the study is to assess the objective radiographic response rate of sirolimus treatment according to the central review. The following are the secondary study objectives:\nTo assess the radiological response rate at 12 weeks and 24 weeks and response rate of visceral impairment after sirolimus treatment (respiratory function, pleural effusion, ascites, blood coagulation parameters, bleeding, and pain).\nTo assess the association of radiological response with clinical symptoms improvements.\nTo evaluate the quality of life (QOL), activities of daily living (ADL), laboratory examinations, vital signs, and pharmacokinetic data after sirolimus treatment.\nTo assess the safety (adverse events and side effects) of sirolimus treatment in patients with LAs.\n2.2. Study outline and enrollment\nThis is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, prospective trial at 5 institutions in Japan (Gifu University Hospital, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, National Center for Child Health and Development, and Keio University School of Medicine). Patients who meet the eligibility criteria and who provide obtained informed consent will be enrolled within 28 days of obtaining consent. The first sirolimus dose is administered within 7 days of enrollment (Fig. 1).\n\nTrial design. Screening, enrollment, treatment period, and post-observation period.\n2.3. Eligibility criteria\nOver 0.6 m2 of body surface area (BSA) at enrollment, and judged by the investigator to be able to take tablets. The trial is open to patients of either sex and of any age.\nDefinitely diagnosed with cystic LM (head, neck, thoracic, peritoneal cavity, or retroperitoneum), GLA, or GSD according to diagnostic criteria, and excluding other lymphatic diseases (channel type LM, primary lymphedema, and others).\nHaving at least one target lesion (e.g., cystic LM, lymphedema) that is measureable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nWith intractable and severe disorders and symptoms because of the target disease (bleeding, chronic pain, recurrent cellulitis [>3 episodes/year], ulceration, visceral and/or bone involvement, potential effects on organ function including the eye, airway, and ear).\nWritten consent to participate in this trial was provided by the subjects in person or by a legal representative guardian (when the subject is younger than 20 years at consent).\nHaving received molecular target drugs associated with the mTOR pathway, such as sirolimus, other mTOR inhibitors (e.g., everolimus), or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.g., bevacizumab, sorafenib) within 8 weeks before the first administration of the trial drug.\nWith active infections that require systemic treatment\nPerformance status (PS): Karnofsky PS score ≤30 (≥10 years of age) or Lansky play-PS ≤30 (<10 years) because of permanent sequelae from brain injury.\nWith uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, chronic liver, and kidney disease.\nHaving been administered an immunosuppressant drugs (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or corticosteroids over 4 weeks, except for local injection, inhaled, topical, or physiological maintenance dose administration.\nWith a history of an allergic reaction to sirolimus or any of its additives.\nHaving been administered a drug that inhibits/induces CYP3A4 enzyme activity within 1 week of test drug initiation.\nWith immunodeficiency conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus infection or primary immunodeficiency diseases.\nCarriers of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nPatients who may suffer from malabsorption of sirolimus.\nHaving received surgery (resection, sclerotherapy, or endovascular treatment) for the target lesion within at least 2 weeks prior to the date of obtaining consent for participation in this trial or not be able to deny the possibility of remaining effects induced by surgery.\nHaving been administered therapeutic drugs for the target disease (including propranolol, eppikajutsuto, ougikenchuto, interferon, octreotide, bisphosphonate, or denosumab) within 2 weeks prior to the date of obtaining consent for participation in this trial.\nHaving been administered chemotherapy agents that lead to myelosuppression, or biological products or treatment not covered by insurance, within 4 weeks prior to the date of obtaining consent for participation in this trial.\nHaving received radiation therapy for the target lesion within 24 weeks prior to the date of obtaining consent for participation in this trial.\nPatients who participated in another clinical trial within 4 weeks prior to the date of obtaining consent for participation in this trial.\nPatients with orthodontic appliances, cochlear implants, or other devices that may affect image assessment of MRI.\nPregnant, breast-feeding, or may be pregnant, or without consent to contraception during the clinical trial period.\nJudged by the principal investigator/sub-investigator to be inappropriate for participation in this clinical trial for other reasons.\n2.4. Treatment\nSirolimus (Rapamune tablet, 1 mg) will be administered orally once daily after meals or on an empty stomach. Patient's with a BSA ≥1.0 m2 will be administered 2 mg (2 tablets) once a day, while those with a BSA of <1.0 m2 will be administered 1 mg (1 tablet) once a day. The dose is adjusted so that the nadir concentration remains within 5–15 ng/ml. The first sirolimus level for adjustment will be measured during week 2 (day 12–16) to allow for loading to occur and to approach steady state concentrations. If the trough level of sirolimus is under 5 ng/ml, the dose will be increased by 1 mg steps. The maximum dose per day is 4 mg. If the trough level of sirolimus is over 15 ng/ml within administration of 1 mg once daily, it will be reduced each 48 h. Subsequent trough sirolimus levels will be obtained every 4 weeks.\nDuring sirolimus treatment, patients will not be allowed the following therapies: drugs that may cause adverse effects combined with sirolimus (attenuated live vaccine, chemotherapy agents that lead to myelosuppression), drugs that inhibit/induce CYP3A4 enzyme activity, and therapies for the target disease such as surgery, sclerotherapy, and pharmacotherapies (e.g., prednisone or interferon). However, supportive therapies (antibiotics, blood transfusion, antipyretics, and analgesics) and other drugs that may not affect assessment of the lymphatic lesion will be allowed.\n2.5. Evaluation, laboratory tests and follow\nThe study assessment schedules are summarized in Table 2. For baseline, all patients require an assessment of the affected area by MRI. All MR examinations are performed on a 1.5 T scanner with patients in the supine position. Routine T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T2-weighted fat saturated, and three-dimensional fat sat T2-weighted sequences are obtained. The axial T2-weighted fat saturated sequence and the effects of slice thickness between 5 and 8 mm without gap will be used as definitive evaluation. The areas of the lymphatic cyst, lymphedema, and lymph fluids will be measured using T2 fat-saturated images, as these lesions show clear high-signal intensities. If the lesions are diffuse or large, we will base the measuring range on the normal organ position and landmarks (e.g., location of spine). After 12, 24, and 52 weeks, the patient will be assessed for clinical response by MRI. If the patients show disease progression (≥20% increase of target lesion evident on radiographic imaging from baseline) after 24 weeks, the patient will be removed from the study protocol. Other patients will continue sirolimus treatment for up to a further 28 weeks (total 52 weeks). Tests for QOL, respiration, pain, and bleeding will be performed at weeks 12, 24, and 52. Other physical and laboratory examinations will be performed monthly. There will also be a post-observation period at 4 weeks after final administration.\nTime and event table.\nMRI: magnetic resonance imaging; QOL: quality of life.\nExcept weeks 12, 24, and 52.\nRadiological volumetric changes are assessed by MRIs of target lesions at 52 weeks after initiating treatment with sirolimus. The primary endpoint is the response rate (the percentage of patients who achieved complete responses or partial responses).\n2.6. Endpoints\nThe primary endpoint is response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved complete response or partial response at 52 weeks after initiating treatment with the trial drug. The radiological volumetric change will be assessed by MR Imaging of the target lesion. The area dimensions of lymphatic tissue or cysts demonstrated by MR imaging with T2 fat saturated sequences will be measured with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) viewer (OsiriX © v.9.0; Pixmeo. Bernex, Switzerland). MR images are evaluated by 2 independent central radiologists blinded to patient identity. Quantitative analysis will be automatically performed to measure the area dimensions of the lesion using the region of interest (ROI) tool (Fig. 2). If ROIs cannot be calculated because of intricate shapes of the lesion, measurement is performed with use of a manual computing tool (closed polygon ROIs). Other pathologic lesions, namely inflammation, bleeding, and hematoma, will be removed. The volume of the target lesion is calculated by multiplying these ROI areas by the slice width. The evaluation criteria are defined as follows: Complete response: disappearance of all target lesions, partial response: at least a 20% decrease of the volume of the target lesion, progressive disease: a 20% or greater increase in volume of the target lesion, and stable disease: insufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response and insufficient growth to qualify for progressive disease.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the regions of interests (ROIs) in a patient with cervical cystic lymphatic malformation (LM) A 1-year-old boy with cystic LM involving the tongue and cervical region (2A, 2C) Axial and coronal view of T2-weighted fat saturated MRI of the neck shows cystic LM. (2B, 2D) The light green area shows the ROIs measured by OsiriX software.\nThe secondary endpoints are the response rate at 12 weeks and 24 weeks, respiratory function, pleural effusion, ascites, blood coagulation parameters, bleeding, pain, QOL, ADL, adverse events, side effects (aphthous ulcers, leukopenia, hypercholesterolemia and opportunistic infections are common), laboratory examinations (complete blood count, liver and lipid profile), vital signs, and pharmacokinetic data. Bleeding, pain, QOL, ADL, and adverse events will be measured using the World Health Organization-Bleeding Scale [9], visual analogue scale for pain [10], PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales (<25 years old) [11], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) (>25 years old) [12], Karnofsky Performance Status (>10 years old), Lansky play-performance scale (for patients <10 years old), and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V4.0, respectively.\n2.7. Primary-endpoint analysis\nPrimary analysis will be performed on the full analysis set consisting of all enrolled patients who will receive at least one dose of sirolimus, will be measured for the efficacy variable at least once after enrollment, and will have no critical good clinical practice violation. The response rate at 52 weeks and its exact 95% confidence interval will be calculated. If the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval regarding the response rate is greater than 5%, we would conclude that the efficacy of sirolimus is confirmed. Furthermore, the exact binomial test for null hypothesis that the response rate is less than 5% will be performed.\n2.8. Sample size\nBecause there is little evidence regarding the natural history of intractable LAs and the efficacy of traditional therapies for these conditions, we used retrospective data from a national survey on intractable LAs (unpublished data) to determine sample size. We examined data from 40 patients (22 with GLA, 18 with GSD) who had not received surgery, radiation therapy, or drug therapies. Volumetric changes on radiologic examination were measured and response rates were calculated retrospectively. None of the 40 patients showed radiological improvement (more than 20% decrease in volume of the target lesion) for at least 1 year. Among 19 patients with intractable cystic LM, only one (5.3%) showed radiological improvement. Thus, of the 59 cases evaluated, the lesion shrank in only one (1.7%), with a threshold response rate of 5%.\nIn a clinical trial conducted in the United States in 2009 that included 53 cases, the response rate (shrinkage exceeding 20% of the target lesion size) determined by MRI after 12 months of sirolimus administration (12 courses) was 52% (95% confidence interval: 36–69%) [8]. Furthermore, in a clinical trial in Japan (unpublished data), the response rate (shrinkage exceeding 20% of the target lesion size) for cystic LM, GLA, and GSD was 66.7% (10/15 cases) at 12 months after administration of sirolimus, while the response rate was 50.0% (4/8 cases) when patients aged 6 years or younger (who were unable to take tablets) were excluded. Thus, the expected response rate was determined as 50%. The sample size was calculated based on the probability that the lower limit of the exact 95% confidence interval for the primary endpoint would be greater than the threshold of 5%. To maintain a probability of at least 90%, nine patients were needed. In consideration of drop-out, the target sample size was 10.\n2.9. Ethics and dissemination\nApproval for this clinical trial was obtained from the institutional review boards of each participating facility (Gifu University Hospital, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, National Center for Child Health and Development, and Keio University School of Medicine). The study protocol, informed consent form, and other documents were reviewed and approved. This study has been registered at the Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR) (UMIN000028905). The principal investigator (sub-investigator) will provide sufficient explanation to subjects using consent information sheets before their participation in the trial, and will obtain written consent to participate in the present clinical trial based on each subject's free will. Final data will be publicly disseminated regardless of the results. A report releasing the study results will be submitted in an appropriate journal.\n2.10. Maintaining data confidentiality\nAll study-related information will be stored securely at the study site. All participant information will be stored in locked file cabinets in areas with limited access. All laboratory specimens, reports, data collection, process, and administrative forms will be identified by coded ID numbers only, to maintain participant confidentiality. All local databases will be secured with password-protected access systems. The Data Management Coordinating Center will oversee the study data using electronic data capture.\n3. Discussion\nThere are currently no standard treatments for intractable LAs, and new drugs are urgently required for these refractory and potentially fatal disorders. Both domestic and international reports have indicated the efficacy of sirolimus on intractable LAs, suggesting that further clinical trials are important. Sirolimus has also been shown to improve various clinical symptoms, which may allow subsequent surgery and sclerotherapy. Thus, the results of this trial will provide key new data for approval of sirolimus for treatment of intractable LAs.\nThe functional mechanism of sirolimus for LM lesions is poorly understood, although several clinical trials showing efficacy of sirolimus have been reported. In 2011, Hammill et al. reported their preliminary experience using sirolimus for treatment of complicated vascular anomalies in children [6]. The prospective trial by Adams et al. also indicated that sirolimus had an excellent effect for LAs, with a good response observed in all GLA and GSD patients [13]. However, it remains unclear how sirolimus acts on the lymphatic endothelial cells and LM lesions in these patients.\nThe pathophysiology of the mTOR signaling pathway may explain the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitors in vascular anomalies [6]. The mTOR protein is a serine–threonine kinase regulated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase, which has a central role in the complex intracellular signaling pathways involved in important processes such as cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cellular metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. Sirolimus is thought to reduce phosphoinositide-3-kinase phosphorylation, and thus reduce proliferation and sprouting of LM lymphatic endothelial cells [7]. We assume that sirolimus will help restore the normal structure in the LM lesion and reduce the lesion volume by correcting the lymphatic flow. Thus, we will examine whether a reduction in the target lesion leads to improvement of symptoms in this study, and have designed an objective volumetric analysis of the target lesion.\nFew studies have assessed the efficacy of pharmacological therapy for LAs. LAs are heterogeneous, and have variable symptoms and lesions. Thus, assessments used in previous studies were not standardized. A previous phase II trial reported 3 distinct assessments involving radiological examination, functional impairment score, and health-related QOL (FACT-G and PedsQL) [13]. In our study, disease response will be established by changes in at least 1 of these parameters. Identifying functional impairment with scores has never been validated for quantification of LAs. Thus, we will also analyze various parameters as secondary endpoints, including respiratory function, pleural effusion, ascites, blood coagulation parameters, bleeding, pain, QOL, ADL, clinical examinations, and vital signs. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to analyze these disparate symptoms unitarily. Development of these assessments should be addressed in future studies.\nThere are limited studies using radiological assessment for LM lesions. However, we will use MR imaging to assess volumetric changes. MR imaging is the primary noninvasive imaging modality used for evaluation of vascular anomalies. MR imaging provides superior soft tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capability, and thus is particularly useful for assessment of LM lesions. Furthermore, the use of a central reviewer provides objective radiological assessment. We will measure the area of the lymphatic cyst, lymphedema, and lymph fluid using T2 fat saturated images as these lesions show clear high signal intensities. OsiriX is an easy to use open source software that provides advanced post-processing imaging protocols, thus making it a versatile DICOM viewer. Our study protocol will use novel and simple methods of radiological assessment.\nThe optimal dose of sirolimus remains controversial. Currently, there are no standardized methods for the optimum dosing of sirolimus. Previous studies utilized trough doses of sirolimus adjusted to 5–15 ng/ml or 10–15 ng/ml. In phase II trials, trough levels were maintained at 10–15 ng/ml [13], [14]. A systematic review of sirolimus treatment for vascular anomalies also reported that the expected trough levels of sirolimus for most studies (19/25, 76.0%) were 5–15 ng/ml [15]. Furthermore, in the phase I−II trial of sirolimus treatment for lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the trough levels were maintained at 5–15 ng/ml [16]. In our clinical trial for LAs in Japan, the efficacy and safety of sirolimus treatment was also similar to these studies. Thus, we will measure sirolimus levels at each follow-up visit, and maintain at 5–15 ng/ml.\nThe standard first dosage of sirolimus is also unclear. In a recent review, Nadal et al. reported heterogeneous dosing, although 1.6 mg/m2/day in 2 doses was most common [15]. Unfortunately, liquid sirolimus is not currently approved in Japan. Thus, our study patients will receive over 0.6 m2 BSA (as the minimum dose is 1 mg), and be assessed by the investigator to be able to take tablets. We will also divide into 2 patterns according to the patient's BSA (2 mg: BSA ≥1.0 m2 and 1 mg: BSA of <1.0 m2). Although neonates and infant cannot participate in our study, clinical trials for pediatric patients are required in the future.\nThere are some limitations of this study. First, the natural history of LAs and the expected benefits of other treatments are unknown, and there is no standard treatment for LAs. Thus, there are limited data for statistical analysis. We used several domestic and international studies as a reference. Second, even though the volumetric assessment methods using OsiriX software are standardized, and use experienced assessors, it is difficult to prevent evaluation error between multiple radiologists. To minimize this potential bias, the investigator will measure the area twice, and if the error between each result is >10%, the analysis will be performed again. Third, the sizes of these lesions are sometimes variable because of infection, trauma or spontaneous intralesional bleeding. We are permitted to move the evaluation date 4 weeks before or after the original evaluation date to prevent incorrect evaluations associated with pseudo-progression, patients with target lesions that are difficult or impossible to evaluate with precision because of obvious infection or bleeding, or because of other factors. Another limitation is the single-arm design of this study, although this was because of ethical considerations for patients with intractable LAs and the rarity of these diseases. Nevertheless, if our study confirms the effectiveness of sirolimus, this will provide important information for clinicians.\n4.

Nevertheless, sirolimus is readily available, has been well-studied in organ transplant patients, and demonstrates efficacy in several preclinical cancer models.\nExperimental Design\nThree simultaneously conducted phase I studies in advanced cancer patients utilized an adaptive escalation design to find the dose of oral, weekly sirolimus alone or in combination with either ketoconazole or grapefruit juice that achieves similar blood concentrations as its intravenously administered and approved prodrug, temsirolimus. Additionally, the effect of sirolimus on inhibition of p70S6 kinase phosphorylation in peripheral T cells was determined.\nResults\nCollectively, the three studies enrolled 138 subjects. The most commonly observed toxicities were hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and lymphopenia in 52%, 43%, and 41% of subjects, respectively. The target sirolimus area under the concentration curve (AUC) of 3810 ng-hr/ml was achieved at sirolimus doses of 90 mg, 16 mg, and 25 mg in the sirolimus alone, sirolimus plus ketoconazole, and sirolimus plus grapefruit juice studies, respectively. Ketoconazole and grapefruit juice increased sirolimus AUC approximately 500% and 350%, respectively. Inhibition of p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation was observed at all doses of sirolimus and correlated with blood concentrations. One partial response was observed in a patient with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\nConclusion\nSirolimus can be feasibly administered orally, once weekly with a similar toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile compared to other mTOR inhibitors and warrants further evaluation in studies of its comparative effectiveness relative to recently approved sirolimus analogues.\nKeywords: Sirolimus, mTOR, Phase 1, CYP3A modulation\nIntroduction\nSirolimus (rapamycin) was discovered in 1975 and initially developed as an antibiotic because of its antiproliferative properties. The realization that this effect is exerted on bacteria and human cells in an indiscriminate manner led to preclinical and clinical studies of the drug as an immunomodulator and antineoplastic agent. Sirolimus was eventually approved by regulatory authorities for prophylaxis of renal allograft rejection and is now commercially available. Moreover, it has shown activity in some cancers including Kaposi’s sarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in addition to tolerability in combination with other targeted agents (1–5). However, its potential in oncology was not fully explored in favor of newly patented analogues that have since been approved in the treatment of renal cell and neuroendocrine carcinoma, and have demonstrated activity in other malignancies.\nThe mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and a key regulator of protein translation via its ability to phosphorylate S6K and 4EBP1 (6–10). Sirolimus binds intracellularly to FK-506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12), inhibiting mTOR, and resulting in growth inhibition in preclinical tumor models primarily by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (11–13). Intermittent dosing schedules in animal models have demonstrated antitumor activity equivalent to continuous administration, but without prolonged immunosuppression(13).\nOne putative obstacle to sirolimus development has been its low bioavailability which is shared by its analogue, everolimus(14), and is not uncommon in oncologic drugs (15, 16). The pharmacokinetic profile of sirolimus has been well described in single dose experiments in healthy volunteers and multiple dose studies in renal transplant patients (17–19). Absorption after oral administration is rapid with a bioavailability of 14%, a volume of distribution of 12 L/kg (oral multiple dosing), and an elimination half-life of 63 hours (oral single dose). The agent is 92% protein bound and undergoes extensive hepatic and intestinal metabolism via CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, as well as excretion by P-glycoprotein. One potential strategy to increase bioavailability of rapamycin is co-administration with CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole or grapefruit juice, the latter exerting an effect predominantly on intestinal enzymes.\nImportantly, an analogue of sirolimus, temsirolimus, is a prodrug that is hepatically metabolized to the parent compound and has been approved in renal cell carcinoma at an intravenous dosage of 25 mg per week. Based on the reported temsirolimus pharmacokinetics and activity at this dose, we undertook three separate but simultaneously conducted phase 1 studies to find the dose of orally administered weekly sirolimus that would achieve exposure similar to weekly intravenous temsirolimus. We also aimed to evaluate the toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile of intermittently administered sirolimus in patients with advanced malignancies, assess the change in Cmax and AUC when sirolimus was co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole and grapefruit juice), and model the relationship between sirolimus whole blood levels and inhibition of the direct mTOR target p70S6 kinase. These results build on the prior published oncology experience with sirolimus on a daily schedule (20).\nMethods\nEligibility Criteria\nPatients with incurable cancer and no other effective therapy, older than 18 years of age, and with Karnofsky performance status >60% were eligible to participate. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject. All subjects required laboratory parameters that included leukocytes of >3,000/ml, absolute neutrophil count >1,500/ml, platelet count >100,000/ml, total bilirubin within institutional normal limits, serum SGOT and SGPT <2.5 times institutional upper normal limits, serum triglycerides <500 mg/dl, serum creatinine within normal institutional limits, and for the sirolimus alone study, a CD4 count >500/ml. Patients with severe immunodeficient states or uncontrolled brain metastases were excluded.\nDosing Cohorts\nBetween October 2004 and November 2008, subjects were enrolled in three separate Institutional Review Board approved protocols at the University of Chicago (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00707135, NCT00708591, NCT00375245) – sirolimus alone, sirolimus plus ketoconazole, and sirolimus plus grapefruit juice (Supplementary Table 1). Sirolimus was administered once weekly as a 1 mg/ml oral solution (sirolimus alone and sirolimus plus grapefruit juice studies) or as a 1 mg tablet (sirolimus plus ketoconazole study). All studies utilized adaptive escalation designs where sirolimus dose levels were calculated with a goal of reaching an area under the exposure curve (AUC) equivalent to that observed with the approved 25 mg dose of temsirolimus (AUC 3810 ng-hr/ml). At the completion of each cohort, the sirolimus AUC from the previous cohort was calculated as well as the relative change compared to the previous cohort AUC. An estimate of the increase required in sirolimus dose to achieve the target AUC was made assuming a linear relationship between dose and AUC. Each dose escalation was intended to reach between 75–100% of the target dose. Due to gastrointestinal side effects experienced by subjects at the 60 mg sirolimus dose, all subsequent cohorts received sirolimus in divided doses – initially doses were given 4 hours apart and then 24 hours apart in subsequent dose cohorts.\nFor the sirolimus plus ketoconazole study, sirolimus was administered in week 1 and ketoconazole was added to all subsequent doses at a fixed dose of 200 mg bid from week 2 on day 1, followed by 200 mg daily on the next three subsequent days. Since we were trying to inhibit CYP3A, we used the standard dosage approved for fungal infections and prophylaxis. For the sirolimus plus grapefruit juice study, sirolimus was administered alone in week 1 and with grapefruit juice starting in week 2, one day prior to sirolimus. Grapefruit juice (supplied by Florida Department of Citrus), 240 cc, was administered once daily without interruption. This dosing was based on research demonstrating that the half-life of intestinal enzyme inhibition of grapefruit juice is 12 hours(21) thus providing time for modulation prior to sirolimus dosing.\nA single cycle of treatment was defined as 4 consecutive weeks with no scheduled interruptions between treatment cycles. A minimum of 8 consecutive weeks (2 cycles) was administered before re-evaluation of disease status.\nDose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)\nDLTs were defined as the occurrence of any of the following that were deemed at least probably drug-related in cycle 1: grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity except fatigue, nausea, vomiting; grade 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia; grade 4 neutropenia or grade 3 neutropenia associated with temperature >38.3˚C; inability to complete cycle 1 due to toxicity; or delay in administration of scheduled doses of sirolimus greater than 2 weeks due to drug related toxicity of any grade. Both the sirolimus plus ketoconazole and grapefruit juice studies employed a classic '3+3' dose escalation design. In the sirolimus alone study, in order to obtain more samples for pharmacodynamic analysis, a '6+6' design was used, where dose escalation occurred if 0 or 1 out of 6 subjects at the current dose level experienced DLT. If 2 subjects experienced DLT, 6 more subjects were entered at that dose level. If a total of 2 or 3 out of 12 subjects experienced DLT, escalation proceeded to the next dose level. If 4 or more out of 12 subjects experienced DLT, then dose escalation was stopped and the previous dose was declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If 3 or more of the original 6 subjects at any dose level experienced DLT, dose escalation was stopped and the next lower dose level was declared the MTD.\nSirolimus Pharmacokinetics\nSirolimus whole blood concentrations were determined as previously described at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston under the supervision of Dr. Napoli Eaton (22). The concentration data were analyzed by a noncompartmental method due to limited number of patients for each dose level. The analysis was performed using PK Solutions Software (version 2.0; Summit Research Services). In the sirolimus alone study, blood was collected on day 1 (baseline, then 2 and 4 hours post dose), day 2 (prior to dosing then 0.4 and 3 hours post dose), day 4 (48 hours post second dose), day 8 (prior to dosing), and day 29 (prior to dosing). In the sirolimus plus ketoconazole and grapefruit juice studies, blood was collected in week 1 prior to administration of sirolimus alone and then at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours; in week 2 prior to administration of sirolimus and either ketoconazole or grapefruit juice and then at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours; and in week 3 prior to sirolimus administration.\nSirolimus Pharmacodynamics\nmTOR phosphorylates p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) at threonine 389 which most closely correlates with activity in vivo(23). p70S6K phosphorylation at Thr389 was measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) as a potential biomarker of rapamycin activity. Only subjects in the sirolimus alone study underwent determination of phosphorylated p70S6K. Blood for collection of PBL was drawn prior to sirolimus administration at baseline and analyzed again on week 1, day 2; week 1, day 4; week 2, day 1; and week 5, day 1. PBL were separated by Lymphoprep density centrifugation followed by isolation of CD3+ cells using Human T cell Enrichment kit (StemCell Technologies Inc., Cat # 14051A) The CD3+ cells were then treated with medium or PMA and Ionomycin for 1 hour. The cells were lysed and Western blots for phospho- and total p70S6K were performed. The results were analyzed using UN-SCAN-IT software and plotted using Sigmaplot. An indirect response model (24) with rebound effect (25) was used to describe our pharmacodynamic data and estimate the inhibitory effect of sirolimus. This model was built using NONMEM (version VII, level 1, ICON, Ellicott City, MD, USA) in conjunction with a gfortran compiler. First-order conditional estimation (FOCE) with interaction and Advan 8 were applied.\nStatistical Considerations\nWithin-patient absolute changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of sirolimus prior to and after co-administration of ketoconazole or grapefruit juice were estimated. At each dose level, the signed rank test was used to determine whether these changes were significantly different from zero. The relationship between changes in PK parameters and dose level were assessed using the nonparametric trend test. The relationship between observed (DV) and predicted p70S6 kinase phosphorylation at Thr389 was evaluated using a linear regression model among all samples. Response was assessed using RECIST 1.0.\nResults\nPatient Demographics\nA total of 138 subjects were enrolled in the combined studies (Supplementary Table 1) and their characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.\nAdverse Events\nToxicity and DLT observed on all three studies are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The most common toxicities attributed to sirolimus observed throughout all three studies were hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, lymphopenia, anemia, and diarrhea. In the sirolimus alone study, the single weekly dose of 60 mg was associated with significant diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset so subsequent cohorts were administered split doses either 4 or 24 hours apart. Gastrointestinal toxicity on the split dose level consisted of diarrhea, nausea, and emesis. These were managed conservatively with antidiarrheals (loperamide or diphenoxylate/atropine as needed) and antiemetics. All subjects were able to continue therapy although one required dose interruption due to diarrhea.\nAdverse events observed in each protocol listed alphabetically by dose level. Numbers in parentheses represent grade 3 or 4 toxicity.\nDose limiting toxicities (DLT) observed in all three studies\nThese occurred concurrently in the same subject\nPharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics\nOf the total enrolled 138 patients, 101 patients were evaluable for pharmacokinetics (Tables 3 and 4). Sirolimus concentrations were significantly increased by both ketoconazole and grapefruit juice at all dose levels (Supplementary Table 3). The highest dose levels in both studies exceeded our minimal target AUC goal of 3810 ng-hr/ml. When sirolimus was administered alone, gastrointestinal toxicity necessitated splitting the dose into two equal administrations. Although five subjects were accrued to the 45 mg-24 hours apart dose level, only two subjects were evaluable for pharmacokinetic analysis. Data from this cohort suggested that a 90 mg total weekly dose would achieve AUC close to the target, and thus accrual to the sirolimus alone study was stopped.\nPharmacokinetic analysis (non-compartmental analysis) of sirolimus with or without ketoconazole or grapefruit juice\np<0.05 for combined dose levels\nCalculated sirolimus pharmacokinetics. Mean values are shown for each parameter.\nWe chose to examine a phosphorylation site on the direct mTOR substrate, Thr389 on p70S6K, as a pharmacodynamic marker of sirolimus activity in the sirolimus alone study. We observed inhibition of phospho-p70S6K 48 hours after administration of sirolimus at all dose levels (Figure 1, p = 0.006). Interestingly, even at the 10 mg weekly dose, phospho-p70S6K activity was suppressed 1 week after the initial dose (data not shown).\n\n(A) Representative Western blot from a subject sample probed for phosphorylated and total p70S6 kinase. Cryo-preserved human CD3+ cells were treated with or without PMA (0.5 µg/ml) plus Ionomycin (0.025 µg/ml) for 1 hr at 37° C. Cells were lysed and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The blots were probed with anti-phosphorylated p70S6 kinase (Thr389) (108D2, Cell Signaling Technology) and developed according to manufacture’s procedure. The blots were then stripped and reprobed for total p70S6 kinase (Cell Signaling Technology). (B) The results were scanned and the densities of phospho- and total p70S6 kinase were analyzed using UNSCANIT software. Results were averaged by dose cohort and plotted using Simgaplot software. Pre = samples prior to administration of sirolimus. D2 = samples collected on day 2 after administration of sirolimus. Error bars represent standard deviation. P value (p = 0.006) was calculated using paired t-test.\nIn addition, we modeled the relationship between suppression of phospho-p70S6K and sirolimus concentration. In our model, the change of phospho-p70S6K was described by kin (zero-order constant rates for gain) and kout (first-order constant rate for loss) where baseline phosphorylation is 100%. Sirolimus has an inhibitory effect on the kin decreasing the level of phospho-p70S6K. The inhibition exhibits linear correlation with the concentration of sirolimus (Csiro) with a coefficient of keffect. The observed and predicted phosphorylation levels were well correlated (Figure 2A). The production rate of phospho-p70S6K decreases to kin × (1–keffect × Csiro), while the patients are taking sirolimus. Paradoxically, in six out of twelve subjects we observed a rebound effect on phospho-p70S6K where phosphorylated protein levels exceeded baseline at later time points (Figure 2B). We determined that the rebound was driven by the concentration of sirolimus, expressed as krebound×Csiro′ (Csiro′ is the concentration of sirolimus in the rebound compartment). The estimated phospho-p70S6K in addition to the rebound is our prediction for the patients with rebound effect. The typical value for kin, kout, keffect and krebound are 5.5, 0.05, 0.08 ml/ng, and 11.3 ml/ng, respectively.\n\n(A) Correlation between observations (DV) and predictions of p70S6 kinase phosphorylation at Thr389 among all samples (R2=0.69, linear regression). An outlier with DV=427 was excluded. (B) Time course of observed phosphorylated p70S6 kinase, by individual subject rebound status.\nEfficacy\nIn the collective studies, one partial response was observed. This subject, diagnosed with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with hepatic metastases, was treated with sirolimus and grapefruit juice. She had been previously treated with sorafenib and developed progressive disease. She remains on sirolimus (with grapefruit juice) more than 3 years after enrollment. Stable disease was observed in 16 (40%), 16 (28%), and 11 (27%) subjects in the sirolimus alone, sirolimus plus ketoconazole, and sirolimus plus grapefruit juice studies, respectively.\nDiscussion\nThese three studies confirm that oral administration of sirolimus is feasible in oncology patients, extending the work of Jimeno and colleagues (20). Our studies demonstrate that weekly oral sirolimus can achieve drug exposure (AUC) similar to that observed with its parenteral prodrug, temsirolimus, and the recommended phase 2 doses from this study are 90 mg, 16 mg, and 35 mg when administered alone, with ketoconazole, and with grapefruit juice, respectively. Notably, the target AUC was attainable at significantly lower sirolimus doses when combined with CYP3A inhibitors, either ketoconazole or grapefruit juice. In fact, when siroliums was combined with grapefruit juice, target AUC was observed at 15, 25, and 35 mg. Toxicity observed with weekly sirolimus was typical of other mTOR inhibitors with glucose, lipid, and hemotologic alterations being most common. In general, weekly sirolimus was well tolerated with relatively few serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities as defined in these studies.\nThese findings carry important implications for development of mTOR inhibitors and oral antineoplastic agents. Sirolimus is commercially available with a safety record much longer than any of its analogues. Moreover, the patents for sirolimus for most oncology uses have expired, and thus the potential exists for substantial cost savings over its analogues. Therefore, sirolimus represents a viable cancer drug whose development would offer several advantages with further cost savings realized by combining the drug with agents that inhibit its metabolism. We hope that our phase I studies provide a basis for initiation of comparative effectiveness studies relative to the more expensive sirolimus analogues.\nMany drugs contain warnings to avoid grapefruit juice or other members of the Rutaceae family, including Seville oranges and pummelo, but this is the first cancer study to harness this drug-food interaction. In 1989, grapefruit juice was serendipitously found to inhibit the metabolism of the calcium channel blocker, felodipine (26, 27). Further research discovered that grapefruit juice is a potent inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2A6 (27). In fact, small bowel enterocyte CYP3A4 protein levels begin to decrease within hours of grapefruit juice administration and the effect is maximal if grapefruit juice is ingested simultaneously or within the previous four hours of drug administration. Furthermore, the half-life of the effect is approximately 12 hours and enzyme levels are reduced by a mean of 62% even after 5 days of grapefruit juice consumption (21). The reduction in protein level is likely post-transcriptional requiring de novo CYP3A4 synthesis (27). Although the magnitude of the interaction is highly variable, it is reproducible within individuals and seems to be dependent on small bowel CYP3A4 content, i.e. persons with the highest intestinal CYP3A4 content have the largest reduction in enzyme levels and subsequently the greatest effect on drug metabolism (27–30).\nInterestingly, different grapefruit juice formulations appear to vary in inhibitory potency and therefore, in consultation with the Florida Department of Citrus, we employed a frozen concentrate product that was tested for furanocoumarin levels prior to delivery of each batch. This ensured consistency across cohorts and is something that must be kept in mind for future studies or applications. Of course, one advantage of grapefruit juice is that it is non-toxic without risk of overdose. Therefore, we have at our disposal an agent that can markedly increase drug bioavailability (in this study by approximately 350%) and, critically in the current environment, decrease prescription drug spending on many agents metabolized by P450 enzymes.\nThe optimal dose and schedule of sirolimus and its analogues are still being debated with current administration schedules varying from weekly (temsirolimus), every other week (ridaforolimus), or daily (everolimus). Daily dosing of sirolimus, the universal and approved schedule employed in the organ allograft setting, has been explored in cancer patients and appears feasible (20). One could, therefore, reasonably expect success administering sirolimus in the same indications as its analogues. Based on the relatively long half-life of sirolimus, our studies hypothesized that sirolimus could be administered on a weekly schedule which would, in turn, simplify administration and provide a period of immune cell recovery and reduce immunosuppressive effects. Weekly administration appears feasible and acceptable to patients.\nIn all subjects, a decrease in PBL phospho-p70S6K expression in response to a dose of sirolimus was observed at 48 hours as expected. However, at later time points in some subjects, PBL phospho-p70S6K expression increased above baseline, which was labeled a rebound effect. The mechanisms underlying this rebound are unclear since sirolimus dosing was continued as planned. Feedback loops clearly exist that can stimulate protein activation in response to mTOR inhibition and such a look has been described linking p70S6K inhibition with acivation of AKT through IRS1(31). Whether this was operational in subjects enrolled in this study and why this was not observed in all subjects needs further investigation. At this time, the impact of the rebound in phospho-p70S6K on efficacy and immune function is unclear.\nThis work and that of others (32–34) would suggest that the optimal biologic dose of mTOR inhibitors may be lower than those currently being administered. This study demonstrated target inhibition, albeit in peripheral blood, at an appreciably lower dose than the highest dose administered. In fact, lower doses of all the available mTOR inhibitors have not been fully explored for comparative effectiveness. Dose finding studies are not necessarily profitable for manufacturers, especially if the drug has been approved, priced, and lower doses prove to be equally active. However, the societal benefits with respect to quality of life and health care costs could be substantial. Zidovudine in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus provides a poignant example of the benefits associated with examination of lower doses (35, 36).\nThere are challenges to incorporating grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, or any inhibitor of drug metabolism into regular practice. For a non-drug product like grapefruit juice one has to assure consistent potency. Moreover, interactions with other concomitantly administered medications must be examined cautiously as well as adherence to regimens that would presumably incorporate at least two agents. In a clinical trial setting we were able to monitor and control these factors. However, there is now considerable evidence that sirolimus can be tolerably and feasibly administered to cancer patients(1–5, 20). There are ostensible and indubitable advantages to developing sirolimus over other mTOR inhibitors while this work describes strategies to improve bioavailability by combining sirolimus with CYP3A inhibitors. Funding for this development should be critically contemplated by governmental and public agencies, as well as potentially nonprofit biomedical companies (37).\nSupplementary Material\nStatement of Translational Relevance.\nSirolimus is the first mTOR inhibitor to be discovered and utilized pre-clinically in neoplastic disease. It is a commercially available agent with approval as prophylaxis against solid organ allograft rejection. These three simultaneously conducted phase I studies in advanced cancer patients utilized an adaptive escalation design to find the dose of oral, weekly sirolimus alone or in combination with either ketoconazole or grapefruit juice that achieves whole blood concentrations associated with activity of other mTOR inhibitors and inhibition of p70 S6 kinase. Weekly sirolimus was feasibly administered with a similar toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile compared to other mTOR inhibitors. Moreover, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are significantly modulated by ketoconazole and grapefruit juice. These studies provide dosing for future phase 2 and 3 studies of sirolimus in mTOR-responsive malignancies with the potential for significantly lower costs to society compared to sirolimus analogues.\nAcknowledgements\nDan King (Florida Department of Citrus), Dominick’s Supermarkets, Human Immunologic Monitoring Facility, Pharmacology Core of the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center\nSupport: This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (R21CA112951 to E.E.W.C and P30 CA14599 to the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center); Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Pilot Project Grant; and the William F.

Deregulation of the mTOR pathway has been implicated in a number of human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, neurological diseases and genetic disorders. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, has been shown to be useful in the treatment of certain diseases. Here we discuss its mechanism of action and highlight recent findings regarding the effects and limitations of rapamycin monotherapy and the potential utility of combination therapy with rapamycin.\nAn introduction to rapamycin: history and mechanism of action\nRapamycin was initially discovered as an antifungal metabolite produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus from a soil sample of Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui). Subsequently, rapamycin was found to possess immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative properties in mammalian cells, spurring an interest in identifying the mode of action of rapamycin. Rapamycin was shown to be a potent inhibitor of S6K1 activation, a serine/threonine kinase activated by a variety of agonists (Chung et al., 1992; Kuo et al., 1992; Price et al., 1992) and an important mediator of PI3 kinase signaling (Chung et al., 1994). Concurrently, the target of rapamycin (TOR) was identified in yeast and animal cells (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012; Loewith and Hall, 2011). Rapamycin forms a gain-of-function complex with the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), and this complex binds and specifically acts as an allosteric inhibitor of mammalian TOR (mTOR, also known as mechanistic TOR) complex 1 (mTORC1).\nBiochemical and genetic analysis of mTOR has demonstrated that it is present in two functionally distinct complexes. The core components of mTORC1 consist of mTOR, mammalian lethal with sec-13 protein 8 (mLST8) and regulatory associated protein of TOR (raptor). Additional components include DEP-domain containing mTOR interacting protein (DEPTOR) and Proline–rich Akt substrate 40kDa (PRAS40). The mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) core is composed of mTOR, rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR (rictor), stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1 (mSIN1) and mLST8. Protein observed with rictor 1/2 (protor 1/2) and DEPTOR are additional regulatory components (Cornu et al., 2013; Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic inhibition factor eIF4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) are two well characterized substrates of mTORC1 (Ma and Blenis, 2009). Only mTORC1 is acutely sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin. However, long-term exposure to rapamycin inhibits mTORC2 in some cell types by sequestering newly synthesized mTOR molecules (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012).\nOver the past two decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the complexity of mTORC1 regulation and its roles in disease. mTORC1 is a signal integrator responding to multiple signals from growth factors, nutrients, energy and oxygen status to control processes that are required for cell growth and proliferation, including mRNA biogenesis, protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis, energy metabolism and autophagy (Figure 1). Improper regulation of the mTORC1 pathway is frequently found in cancers as well as in several genetic disorders. Recent evidence indicates that mTORC1 is also an important modulator for aging and age-related diseases (Johnson et al., 2013a). In contrast to mTORC1, much less is known about mTORC2. mTORC2 participates in cell survival via activation of Akt and SGK1. mTORC2 also regulates organization of the actin cytoskeleton through activation of PKCα, paxillin and small GTPases, Rho and Rac (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012)\nFigure 1.\n\nThe two mTOR complexes and the regulation of key cellular processes. mTOR exists in two functionally distinct complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 integrates multiple signals from growth factors, oxygen, energy levels and nutrients such as amino acids to promote cell growth and proliferation by activation of anabolic processes such as protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis, stimulation of energy metabolism such as glycolysis and glutaminolysis, and inhibition of catabolic process such as autophagy. Unlike mTORC1, mTORC2 only responds to growth factors and regulates actin/cytoskeleton organization and cell survival through the pathways as shown above. Rapamycin acutely inhibits mTORC1 whereas chronic exposure to rapamycin can also inhibit mTORC2.\nEffects of rapamycin in cancer\nIncreased activation of mTORC1 is observed in numerous human cancers due to gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes (i.e., PI3K, AKT, or Ras) and/or loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors (i.e., PTEN, LKB1 or TSC1/2), upstream regulators of mTORC1. These mutations provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage in comparison to normal cells (Menon and Manning, 2008). In order to meet the high demands of proliferation, cancer cells often have fundamental alterations in nutrient uptake and energy metabolism, processes that are directly controlled by the mTORC1 pathway. Accordingly, in addition to driving protein synthesis, oncogenic activation of mTORC1 promotes a gene expression program that is involved in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming. Activation of mTORC1 promotes glycolysis via upregulation of Hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF1α) and c-Myc; stimulates lipid biosynthesis and the pentose phosphate pathway through sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) (Yecies and Manning, 2011); and positively controls glutamine metabolism by SIRT4 repression (Csibi et al., 2013). Thus, drugs that selectively target mTORC1, like rapamycin, are expected to impair cancer metabolism and are considered promising anti-cancer therapies.\nThe poor solubility and pharmacokinetics of rapamycin triggered the development of several rapamycin analogs (rapalogs). Two water-soluble derivatives of rapamycin, temsirolimus and everolimus, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007 and 2009, respectively, for the treatment of advanced renal cancer carcinoma (RCC). In 2011, the FDA approved the use of everolimus for patients with progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET). Additionally, temsirolimus was evaluated in several clinical trials for the treatment of advanced neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, approved in the European Union in 2009). Moreover, a few trials of everolimus were conducted in patients with advanced gastric cancer, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Ridaforolimus, a rapamycin analog, was also examined in clinical trials for advanced bone and soft-tissue sarcomas as well as a variety of advanced solid tumors (Wander et al., 2011). Overall, however, rapalogs have only achieved modest effects in major solid tumors in the clinic. The reasons for the limited clinical success of rapalogs have not been established, but are likely related to the large number of mTORC1-regulated negative feedback loops that suppress upstream signaling systems such as activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K-Akt signaling and Ras-ERK pathway and which can be re-activated with rapamycin (discussed more extensively below). In order to overcome these limitations, alternative strategies have been explored in the past few years. For instance, a number of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors have been developed, blocking both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. Due to high sequence homology shared between mTOR and PI3K, some compounds that were originally identified as PI3K inhibitors were later shown to inhibit mTOR. Unlike rapamycin, which is a specific allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1, these ATP-competitive inhibitors target the catalytic site and prevent the feedback-mediated PI3K/Akt activation (described below), and therefore can potentially offer broader, more potent and sustained mTOR inhibition (Benjamin et al., 2011) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.\n\nEffects of rapamycin in various diseases. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that although limited, rapamycin or rapalogs are beneficial for treating various diseases including cancer, diabetes, tuberous sclerosis complex, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. FDA-approved cases are described.\nEffects of rapamycin in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and neurological diseases\nLAM is a rare lung disease characterized by abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells. Infiltration of the lung with these cells by a mysterious mechanism referred to as benign metastasis, can result in an anti-inflammatory response, cyst formation and ultimately respiratory failure (Yu and Henske, 2010). LAM arises almost exclusively in women during their childbearing age, and occurs either as an isolated disorder (sporadic LAM) or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign hamartomatous tumors involving multiple organ systems. Both LAM and TSC are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the TSC genes (TSC1 or TSC2), whose protein products function as a complex to inhibit the activity of mTORC1. Thus, hyperactive mTORC1 signaling is directly linked to the unregulated cell growth that drives the clinical manifestations. Hence, the use of mTORC1 inhibitors could potentially benefit LAM and TSC patients. In the past few years, several clinical trials were conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of rapamycin-based therapy. For example, in 2011, McCormack et al reported a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial in which 89 patients with LAM who had moderate lung impairment were assigned to either sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) or placebo for 1 year, followed by 1-year observation period. Their study demonstrated that treatment with sirolimus for 1-year stabilized lung function and improved quality of life in patients with LAM. However, once patients stopped taking sirolimus, their lung function deteriorated again. The authors concluded that additional trials are required to investigate the duration of treatment and long-term safety of sirolimus (McCormack et al., 2011). Approximately 80% of all TSC patients and 50% of women with LAM also develop angiomyolipomas (AML), which are benign tumors of the kidney. Bissler et al conducted two separate trials to evaluate the use of sirolimus or everolimus for AML in TSC or LAM. Their results showed that sirolimus or everolimus decreased AML volume (Bissler et al., 2013; Bissler et al., 2008). However, the tumors returned to their original states when sirolimus was discontinued, underscoring the cytostatic and not cytotoxic effects of rapamycin and rapalogs. Since rapamycin-based therapy suppresses immune function and may cause serious side effects such as thrombocytopenia and hyperlipidemia, impaired wound healing, nephrotoxicity, and altered insulin sensitivity, the safety of long-term use still remains uncertain.\nA growing body of evidence suggests that the mTORC1 pathway may also be involved in a number of neurological disorders. For instance, patients with TSC are prone to a wide range of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, neurocognitive dysfunction and autism. Therefore, inhibition of mTORC1 is a potential therapeutic option. In a mouse model of TSC, rapamycin treatment was shown to suppress epilepsy, and shortly after, the study by Muncy et al demonstrated that rapamycin reduced seizure frequency in a 10-year-old girl with TSC (Muncy et al., 2009). A recent study by Sato et al reported that rapamycin reverses impaired social interactions associated with autism spectrum disorder in a mouse model of TSC. Their data suggested that the abnormal behaviors displayed by TSC-deficient mice were correlated with altered gene and protein expressions involved in the mTOR signaling (Sato et al., 2012). In 2012, the FDA approved the use of everolimus for the treatment of patients with TSC who have subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), a neurological manifestation of TSC. Currently, there is an ongoing phase 2 trial assessing the possible neurocognitive benefits from treatment with everolimus (NCT01289912). Future therapies involving the use of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors or in combinations with other drugs, such as estrogen antagonists for the treatment of LAM are being explored.\nFinally, a number of studies have indicated that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 can provide neuroprotection in several in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (Bove et al., 2011). Mounting evidence suggested that accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins is a common feature of these diseases, possibly caused by mTORC1-driven protein synthesis and defective autophagic degradation. Thus, suppression of protein synthesis and induction of autophagy by rapamycin may prevent or diminish protein aggregation. Moreover, a recent study has shown that rapamycin improves survival and attenuates disease progression in a mouse model (Ndufs4−/−) of Leigh syndrome, which is a neurological disorder characterized by a genetic defect that disrupts mitochondrial function (Johnson et al., 2013b). For more detailed descriptions of the molecular mechanisms underlying how rapamycin exerts its neuroprotective effect, we refer the readers to a comprehensive review (Bove et al., 2011) (Figure 2).\nEffects of rapamycin on longevity and aging\nmTOR signaling is an important player in longevity regulation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling has been found to extend lifespan of invertebrates including yeast, nematodes and fruit flies (Lamming et al., 2013). In 2009, Harrison et al showed that rapamycin extends both median and maximal lifespan of male and female genetically heterogeneous mice when beginning treatment at 9 or 20-months of age (1.5–2 years duration) (Harrison et al., 2009), representing the first demonstration in mammals. Subsequent work by other groups confirmed the positive effect of rapamycin on lifespan in mice with different genetic backgrounds and other model organisms (Lamming et al., 2013). Two classes of explanations may account for these observations: 1). rapamycin increases lifespan by slowing aging; or 2). rapamycin inhibits detrimental metabolic diseases or lethal neoplastic diseases, independent of aging effects. To test the hypothesis that rapamycin might retard aging in mice, Wilkinson et al used a genetically heterogeneous mouse model and analyzed a number of age-related pathologies as well as age-dependent spontaneous activity of mice upon rapamycin treatment beginning at 9-months of age (1 year duration). Their results suggested that age-dependent changes occur more slowly in rapamycin-treated mice, including alterations in heart, liver, endometrium, adrenal gland, and tendon elasticity. Rapamycin was also shown to diminish age-related decline in spontaneous activity of mice (Wilkinson et al., 2012).\nAs rapamycin is known to have modest anti-proliferative properties in many forms of cancer, lifespan extension by rapamycin could also be caused by suppression of specific life-limiting pathologies (e.g., cancer). In a recent article by Neff et al 2013, several concerns were raised with regard to the previous reports on the effect of rapamycin in slowing aging. For example, cancer is the main cause of death in mice including the mice strain used in the study by Wilkinson et al. In addition, aging-independent effects by rapamycin were not examined previously. In the study by Neff et al 2013, the authors dosed male C57BL/6j mice with rapamycin or vehicle control for 1 year at 3 different treatment onsets: young adulthood (i.e., at 4 months), midlife (i.e., at 13 months), and late in life (i.e., at 20–22 months). After completing the treatment, they performed a large assessment of diverse structural and functional aging phenotypes in a variety of cell types, tissues and organ systems. Intriguingly, while rapamycin did extend lifespan in mice, age-related traits were largely unaffected. Although rapamycin was able to rescue a subset of aging-dependent phenotypes, such as spatial learning and memory impairments, as well as declined exploratory activity, similar positive effects on many of these attributes were also observed in young mice, indicating an age-independent effect. They reasoned that the discrepancy in findings could be due to different mouse models (genetic backgrounds) used in the studies or technical variations in the analysis (Neff et al., 2013), which, however were challenged by Blagosklonny (Blagosklonny, 2013). Clearly, future studies with other mouse strains and gender are warranted (Figure 2).\nEffects of rapamycin on metabolism\nIn response to nutrients and growth factors, mTOR signaling serves as a key regulator of cell metabolism to coordinate the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes. When fasting, muscle and liver produce glucose via glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown) and gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis), and adipose tissue generates fatty acids through lipolysis, whereas, upon feeding, glycogenesis (glycogen synthesis) is favored in muscle and liver, and lipid uptake is favored in adipose tissue. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been linked to the development of a few metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). Inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin has been demonstrated to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on metabolism. For example, acute rapamycin treatment improves insulin sensitivity in vitro and in vivo by disrupting a S6K-mediated feedback loop (described below) (Krebs et al., 2007; Tremblay and Marette, 2001). Moreover, rapamycin treatment inhibits human adipocyte differentiation in vitro (Bell et al., 2000) and protects against high fat diet-induced obesity in C57BL/6J mice (16 weeks) (Chang et al., 2009a). As discussed above, rapamycin appears capable of extending the lifespan of mice and preventing the onset of many age-related diseases, however, deleterious metabolic effects associated with rapamycin were also reported in other studies. For instance, Fradenkel et al found that rapamycin treatment (2 weeks) worsened hyperglycemia in a nutrition-dependent type 2 diabetes mouse model (Fraenkel et al., 2008). Similarly, the study by Chang et al demonstrated that rapamycin administration (6 weeks) exacerbates glucose intolerance in diet-induced obesity KK/HIJ mice (Chang et al., 2009b). Moreover, the study by Houde et al reported that rapamycin treatment (2 weeks) promoted insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia in rats (Houde et al., 2010). It is currently unclear how rapamycin can have both positive and negative effects. In 2012, Lamming et al showed that rapamycin exerts different effects via separate mechanisms. They found that while reduced mTORC1 increases longevity and maintains normal glucose homeostasis, disruption of mTORC2 contributes to insulin resistance in vivo (Lamming et al., 2012). Additionally, Fang and colleagues suggested that these seemingly controversial findings might be explained by the duration of rapamycin treatment (Fang et al., 2013). Their study compared various metabolic effects in male mice after 2, 6, or 20 weeks of rapamycin treatment. After 2 weeks of rapamycin treatment, the mice displayed smaller pancreas and enlarged liver. However, with prolonged treatment, these features returned to normal levels while adiposity, body weight (BW), and food consumption were significantly reduced. More strikingly, insulin sensitivity was altered with respect to different lengths of rapamycin treatment. Under normal physiological conditions, insulin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis while increasing lipogenesis, but in individuals with impaired insulin sensitivity, excess insulin is secreted to compensate for the insulin resistance. In agreement with previous findings by Houde et al (Houde et al., 2010), insulin levels were increased after 2 weeks of rapamycin treatment, and the treated mice became glucose intolerant and insulin resistant. Interestingly, after 6 weeks of treatment the mice exhibited a transition to improved insulin sensitivity and by 20 weeks of rapamycin treatment, insulin levels were decreased while insulin sensitivity increased. Additional metabolic effects including lipid profile, oxygen consumption and ketogenesis were also altered in a manner relative to treatment durations (Fang et al., 2013). Together, these remarkable findings may provide insight into how long-term treatment of rapamycin extends longevity in mice. However, how these studies will translate to human aging is unclear (Figure 2).\nLimitations of monotherapy\nThe beneficial effects of rapamycin have been largely shown in pre-clinical animal models. However, the clinical success of rapamycin has been associated with only a few benign and malignant cancers. Several factors may contribute to the modest outcome in the clinic. 1). Rapamycin and rapalogs are generally cytostatic instead of cytotoxic. Clinical trials have demonstrated that while rapamycin treatment can induce tumor regression, tumors regrow upon the cessation of treatment (Bissler et al., 2008; Marsh et al., 2008) 2). Rapamycin fails to completely inhibit a subset of mTORC1-mediated processes, such as protein synthesis and autophagy. Choo et al reported that rapamycin differentially regulates S6Ks versus 4E-BP1. In several cell types, short-term treatment of rapamycin de-phosphorylates 4E-BP1, however, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 remerges after 12+ hours treatment, resulting in a recovery in cap-dependent translation despite continued inhibition of S6K (Choo et al., 2008). In addition, although it was known that rapamycin effectively activates autophagy in yeast, the induction of autophagy is only mild in mammalian cells (Thoreen and Sabatini, 2009). These partial inhibitory effects may offer a potential explanation for the poor efficacy of rapamycin in clinical trials. However, it is puzzling why mTORC1 substrates have differential sensitivities to rapamycin treatment in cells. In a recent study, Kang and colleagues found that mTORC1 phosphorylation sites are one determinant for the differential responses to rapamycin. It was shown that the ability of mTORC1 to phosphorylate a specific site in vitro has a strong correlation with the respective rapamycin-resistant site in cells. For example, mTORC1 potently phosphorylated the synthetic peptides encompassing 4E-BP1 (T37) and (T46), which are rapamycin resistant. In contrast, mTORC1 weakly phosphorylated S6K1 (T389), which is rapamycin sensitive. Furthermore, their findings indicated that the sequence composition of mTORC1 phosphorylation sites is one essential factor in determining substrate quality within cells. Lastly, Kang et al were able to control mTORC1 activity toward a substrate phosphorylation site in vitro, and subsequently alter substrate sensitivity to rapamycin, nutrient and growth factor levels in cells as well (Kang et al., 2013). 3). Another reason for the limited clinical success of rapalogs is the existence of several feedback loops involved in cell survival responses. For instance, under normal circumstances, mTORC1-mediated activation of S6K1 promotes degradation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and subsequent downregulation of PI3K signaling. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin relieves this negative feedback loop, thereby increasing PI3K signaling. Likewise, mTORC1-mediated signaling via S6K1 also inhibits mTORC2 by phosphorylation of Rictor. Rapamycin blocks this feedback loop, resulting in mTORC2-mediated AKT activation. Additionally, mTORC1 negatively regulates growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10), an inhibitor of PI3K signaling. Thus, rapamycin released mTORC1-mediated inhibition of Grb10, leading to PI3K pathway activation in certain cell types (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012) (Figure 3). 4). Recent studies also demonstrate that inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can lead to reactivation of many receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling systems (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011) 5). Compensatory pathways exist that are often activated in cancer cells or up-regulated in response to chronic rapamycin treatment (discussed above). For example, other AGC kinase family members can compensate for S6K1 inhibition such as RSK and Akt (Mendoza et al., 2011). 6). Finally, eIF4E expression can be up-regulated with chronic inhibition of mTOR (Alain et al., 2012). One of the major unanswered questions in the field is why these various compensatory mechanisms and negative feedback loops are differentially regulated in different organisms or in different cancer cell types. Fully addressing this question will lead to an improved understanding as to why rapalogs work better in some cases than in others, and that should lead to improved therapeutic responses with mTOR inhibitors in monotherapy or combination therapy.\nFigure 3.\n\n(A) Many negative feedback loops in mTOR signaling. When mTORC1 is active, Akt activation is attenuated by inhibition of the RTK-PI3K signaling pathway through multiple mechanisms including inhibitory phosphorylation events on IRS by mTORC1 or S6K1 and Rictor by S6K1, and stimulation of inhibitory adaptor protein Grb10 by mTORC1. (B) Rapamycin relieves negative feedback loops and promotes activation of PI3K signaling. The inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin reduces the mTORC1-driven negative feedback effects, and thus activates the PI3K-Akt pathway and promotes cell survival. Additionally, partial inhibition of mTORC1 substrates by rapamycin such as 4E-BP1 may also contribute to cell survival.\nRapamycin in combination therapy\nThe modest effect of rapamycin-based therapy has prompted investigators to consider other therapeutic options. Combination therapy with rapamycin or rapalogs has become a promising approach as various strategies have the potential of improving drug efficacy by inhibiting multiple targets including those activated by removal of feedback loops or those involved in parallel pathways. Additionally, combination approaches may delay the emergence of drug resistance.\nIn 2012, everolimus was approved by the FDA in combination with exemestane (aromatase inhibitor) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer who experience recurrence or progression after treatment with letrozole or anastrozole (aromatase inhibitors) alone. In addition, multiple clinical trials are currently evaluating the efficacy of rapalogs with several chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel, doxorubicin and capecitabine. Furthermore, pre-clinical and clinical data suggested that rapalogs work effectively with targeted therapies to enhance anti-tumor activity, such as receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) targeted therapy, hormone-based therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors and IGF-IR inhibitor. For example, the combination of rapamycin and erolitinib, (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor), resulted in a synergistic effect in vitro and significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo compared to single agent treatment. This may be linked to the activation of RTKs by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011). In addition, a phase I trial examined the combination of everolimus with pasireotide, a somatostatin analog, in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. The preliminary data showed that the combination induced antitumor activity and further studies are underway (Zaytseva et al., 2012). Furthermore, everolimus was shown to potently inhibit growth in many tumor types with activated mTOR in combination with lower doses of the catalytic mTOR inhibitor BEZ235, used to reduce survival via feedback loops activating Akt (Nyfeler et al., 2012). Many more clinical trials are currently investigating different combination approaches. Exciting outcomes from these studies are anticipated in the near future.\nConclusion and future perspective\nSince the serendipitous discovery of rapamycin, considerable achievements have been made in understanding the mechanism of action and unraveling the intricate signaling network of mTOR. Uncontrolled mTORC1-mediated signaling is often observed in human diseases. Therefore, it was thought that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin would have a substantial and wide range of clinical effects. Although rapamycin-based therapy has shown benefits for patients with RCC, TSC and LAM-related tumors, the use of rapamycin monotherapy in a broad spectrum of metabolic diseases, especially in treating cancers, is limited due to its modest efficacy. This may be explained by the inability of rapamycin to completely block mTORC1-mediated signaling events, the presence of several feedback loops and the up-regulation of compensatory pathways that promote cell survival and growth. Thus, there is a critical need to further define these signaling processes and to develop new strategies that can overcome these drawbacks. The recent emergence of combination therapy with rapamycin may further increase efficacy and bypass feedback activation of survival pathways. Efforts that focus on exploring novel drug combinations with optimal doses will have great potential to yield an improvement of efficacy and safety profiles. Additionally, significant promise remains for the discovery of new pathway inhibitors as well as the possibility that existing bioactives may directly or indirectly reduce mTORC1 and/or mTORC2 activity in monotherapy or in combination.\nAcknowledgments\nWe apologize to those whose work was not discussed and cited in the review due to limitations in space and scope.

Although many lipid-lowering or antiplatelet medicines have been used to prevent the devastating outcomes caused by AS, the serious side effects of these medicines cannot be ignored. Moreover, these medicines are aimed at preventing end-point events rather than addressing the formation and progression of the lesion. Rapamycin (sirolimus), a fermentation product derived from soil samples, has immunosuppressive and anti-proliferation effects. It is an inhibitor of mammalian targets of rapamycin, thereby stimulating autophagy pathways. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that rapamycin possess multiple protective effects against AS through various molecular mechanisms. Moreover, it has been used successfully as an anti-proliferation agent to prevent in-stent restenosis or vascular graft stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease. A thorough understanding of the biomedical regulatory mechanism of rapamycin in AS might reveal pathways for retarding AS. This review summarizes the current knowledge of biomedical mechanisms by which rapamycin retards AS through action on various cells (endothelial cells, macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, and T-cells) in early and advanced AS and describes clinical and potential clinical applications of the agent.\nKeywords: atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immune response, autophagy, rapamycin\nIntroduction\nAtherosclerosis (AS), which is a chronic inflammatory disease, is a major cause of death and a huge economic burden worldwide (Benjamin et al., 2017). AS commonly affects medium-to-large vessels, such as the carotid, coronary and lower extremity arteries. It causes luminal stenosis or obstruction, which can lead to ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and inferior limb ischemia. The atherogenic mechanism is incompletely understood, but impaired lipid metabolism and an unresolved inflammatory and immune-response state have been implicated (Tall and Yvan-Charvet, 2015). AS is initially characterized by a series of events: Circulating monocytes are recruited into the subendothelial layer in response to various stimuli and differentiate into macrophages. The macrophages ingest excessive amounts of modified LDL to form foam cells (Tabas and Lichtman, 2017). At the advanced stage, the main pathological feature of AS is unresolved immune-inflammation and imbalance between apoptotic-cell formation and phagocytosis (Tabas and Bornfeldt, 2016). Finally, atherosclerotic plaque can be vulnerable, with a necrotic lipid core encompassing recruited inflammatory cells, cellular necrosis and a thin fibrous cap with few VSMCs and secreted extracellular matrix. Thrombosis, a devastating event of AS, then is induced (Niccoli et al., 2014). These activities are carried out by various cell types in the vascular system: VSMCs, macrophages, endothelial cells and T-cells are the main cell types implicated (Deanfield et al., 2007; Lacolley et al., 2017; Tabas and Lichtman, 2017). Therefore, exploration of pharmaceutical methods to target the aberrant action of cellular components in atherosclerotic plaque formation is imperative. However, the main therapeutic medications, i.e., lipid-lowering and anti-platelet agents and thrombolytics, have undesirable side effects. Moreover, these “gold standard” drugs, which have the desirable effect of preventing the end-point events of advanced AS, such as acute thrombosis, do not reverse AS or correct the aberrant cellular activities. In recent years, some new compounds have been explored as potential sources of anti-AS medicines. For example, plant constituents, such as flavonoids, have been demonstrated to confer therapeutic effects on AS (Luo Y. et al., 2017). However, lack of clinical trials designed to examine the clinical effects of such natural products limited their use. On the other hand, there is a growing awareness of the role of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of AS, targeting multiple cellular mechanisms (Liu and Huang, 2016). However, compounds included in one herb, even in an extract of one herb, are very complicated; thus, identifying the mechanism of herbs in treating is difficult.\nRapamycin (RAPA), also known as sirolimus, is a fermentation product derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, which was isolated from a soil sample collected on Easter Island in 1976 (Abraham and Wiederrecht, 1996). The product was initially used in treating carcinoma or organ transplant rejection as an anti-proliferation, immunosuppressive agent (Garcia and Rini, 2007; Chih et al., 2016). Since 2003, SES have been used to treat de novo AS and in-stent or graft restenosis through the drug’s anti-AS effects. Also, through in vitro and in vivo studies, RAPA has demonstrated pleiotropic effects on cell types involved in AS through multiple signaling pathways that mediate anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation, immunoregulation and lipid-regulatory processes. Above all, RAPA, as an autophagy stimulator, can modulate cellular autophagy, thereby modifying the balance of cellular proliferation and survival (Sanchez-Plumed et al., 2006). An imbalance in these activities is considered a crucial component in the pathogenesis of AS. Therefore, this natural product is a potential candidate for the prevention or treatment of AS.\nRapamycin\nRAPA (C51H79NO13) was initially found as a lipophilic macrolide antibiotic that inhibits the growth of filamentous fungi (Sehgal et al., 1975). Although it does not have powerful antibiotic effects, RAPA has been used as a potent immunosuppressant agent to suppress allograft rejection in heart (Keogh et al., 2004), liver (Trotter et al., 2001), lung (Shitrit et al., 2005), and kidney (Kahan et al., 1998; Cowan and Heizer, 2000; Kahan, 2000) transplantation. RAPA interferes with crucial signal transduction pathways through binding with FK506-binding-protein. It then inhibits the CKI p27kipl, thereby retarding cell-cycle progression at the G1/S transition (Abraham and Wiederrecht, 1996).\nOn the other hand, the mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase, forms two complexes with distinct proteins: mTORC1 and mTORC2. These proteins are direct targets of RAPA and regulate protein synthesis; cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival; and lipid metabolism (Soltani et al., 2018). The mTORC1 composite consists mainly of mTOR, raptor, and G-protein β-subunit protein (GßL). The ribosomal protein S6K1-ribosomal protein S6 pathway and eukaryotic initiation factor 4EBP-1, as two direct targets of mTORC1, are phosphorylated by mTORC1 after stimulation with growth factors or other factors, thereby stimulating RNA and protein synthesis, cell growth and cell survival (Nemchenko et al., 2011). RAPA inhibits the kinase activity of mTORC1 through binding to the FKBP (FK-binding-protein) 12–rapamycin-binding domain; through this mechanism, cells are differentiated and less proliferative (Tarantino and Capone, 2013). The chemical structure and mechanism of actions were summarized in Figure 1.\nFIGURE 1.\n\nThe cellular functions and mechanisms of rapamycin. (A) The chemical structure of rapamycin obtained from PubChem database. (B) Rapamycin-induced cellular functional changes and mechanisms. Upon reaction with stimulators, such as growth factors, insulin, or adequate nutrients, the PI3K-AKT pathway is driven, followed by the activation of mTORC1. Then, S6K1-S6 and 4EBP-1 pathways, two direct targets of mTORC1, are phosphorylated by activated mTORC1, thereby promoting RNA and protein synthesis. Rapamycin can inhibit the kinase activity of mTORC1, thereby inhibiting synthesis. On the other hand, rapamycin can retard cell-cycle progression at the G1/S transition. mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; GβL, G-protein β-subunit like protein; mTORC1, mTOR complex 1; S6K1-S6, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1-ribosomal protein S6; 4EBP-1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1; Atg1, autophagy-related genes; FKBP12, FK-binding-protein-12.\nEarly Atherosclerosis\nEarly AS formation is characterized by endothelial-monocyte interaction, foam cell formation and the de-differentiation of VSMCs. In its initial stage of AS, the loss of integrity of the endothelial layer is a requisite for the formation and development of the lesion (Roth et al., 2015). Normal vasoconstriction and relaxation of endothelial cells are requisites for maintaining vascular homeostasis. These activities are largely determined by NO, produced by activation of eNOS (Mineo and Shaul, 2013). Decreased production of NO in endothelial cells, causing excessive vasoconstriction, can contribute to the initiation of AS and in-stent restenosis. Meanwhile, driven by factors such as shear stress, oxidative stress or high glucose concentrations, vascular adhesion molecules, including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin, are induced. Circulating monocytes then are incorporated into the subendothelial layer, where they engulf oxidized lipid and help promote AS (Schmitt et al., 2014; Khodabandehlou et al., 2017). In turn, deposited OX-LDL can increase the expression of adhesion molecules, leading to recruitment of more inflammatory cells.\nAfter being enrolled into the subendothelial layer, monocyte-derived macrophages engorge cholesterol and form foam cells. Accumulation of foam cells results from discrepancy between uncontrolled modified lipid uptake and insufficient efflux (Randolph, 2014). Depending on SRs, including SR-A, SR-BII, CD36, and LOX-1, infiltrated macrophages engulf OX-LDL and form foam cells (Tall and Yvan-Charvet, 2015). On the other hand, the ABCA1 and G1 (ABCG1) modulate cholesterol efflux and retard foam cell formation. This process is mainly regulated by two main nuclear hormone receptors: PPAR-γ and its downstream target, LXRα. OX-LDL can then be absorbed by endothelial cells and macrophages through scavenger or LOX-1 receptors (Kume and Kita, 2004; Akhmedov et al., 2014). Therefore, targeting lipid-laden macrophages and endothelial cells by inhibiting lipid uptake and enhancing cholesterol efflux is an effective method for inhibiting AS formation.\nFollowing the endothelial activation and monocyte recruitment, VSMCs contribute to AS formation. Normally, VSMCs are located in vessel media, with a well-recognized phenotype (“contractile”), functioning as a relaxation and constriction mediator. In pathological conditions, when atherogenic stimuli such as OX-LDL are present, VSMCs take on synthetic, dedifferentiated phenotype. Their migratory and proliferative abilities are activated, i.e., VSMC migration into the intima and hyperplasia and secretion of extracellular matrix, resulting in thickening and stiffness of vessel intima (Farb et al., 2004; Bennett et al., 2016). Suppression of VSMC phenotypic transformation, therefore, may be an effective strategy for retarding AS formation.\nAdvanced Atherosclerosis\nAdvanced AS is characterized by unresolved inflammatory response and excessive cellular apoptosis and death. The inflammatory immune responses, which are dominated by macrophages, are the major contributors to the unresolved inflammation in AS (Tabas and Bornfeldt, 2016). The innate inflammatory response is mainly regulated by TLR4, an immune receptor for detecting damage-associated molecular patterns. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response is mainly mediated by T cells and is modulated principally by mechanisms that, in AS, affect the balance between regulatory and effector T cells. Mechanistically, a skew toward effector T cells other than Treg cells promotes AS, and Treg cells are decreased in AS (Tabas and Lichtman, 2017). Treg cells have anti-inflammatory properties and release TGF-β. In brief, the inflammatory elements in vessels can drive the oxidation of LDL, leading to further formation of foam cells, thus creating a vicious cycle to promote the development of AS. Therefore, decreasing innate and adaptive immune response may be an effective strategy for retarding AS development.\nIn advanced AS lesions, excessive macrophage or VSMCs-derived foam-cell populations can induce increased inflammatory response and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase and ROS, which cause cellular apoptosis and cell death (Allahverdian et al., 2014). During the process, where excessive stress (oxidative, metabolic, or inflammatory) exists, autophagy becomes impaired, which makes macrophages and VSMCs vulnerable to apoptotic stimuli, resulting in plaque instability (De Meyer et al., 2015). Therefore, the strategy of inhibiting cellular apoptosis and death via enhancing autophagy is logical for preventing plaque formation. Addtionally, senescent VSMCs, which are commonly present in unstable human carotid plaque, have been reported to have impaired self-repairing capacity, which lessens the protective components in plaque (Gardner et al., 2015). Hence, inhibiting cellular senescence is a potent method for maintaining plaque stability.\nAnti-Atherosclerotic Effects of Rapamycin\nEmerging evidence has demonstrated that RAPA has pleiotropic protective function against AS and therefore may have therapeutic value. In animal models, RAPA decreased plaque burden (Elloso et al., 2003; Castro et al., 2004; Pakala et al., 2005; Gadioli et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). It also enhanced the stability of plaque (Chen et al., 2009; Luo Z. et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2017), which was characterized by increased fibrous cap content, decreased necrotic core, and attenuated inflammation of plaque (summarized in Table 1). The anti-AS mechanisms of RAPA are elaborated through anti-inflammatory immune, lipid-modulatory, apoptosis and autophagy, and anti-thrombotic effects in multiple cellular models that simulate early and advanced AS formation. Anti-AS effects of RAPA and its molecular targets are summarized in Figure 2.\nTable 1.\nDetails of animal experiments investigating the effects of rapamycin (RAPA) in atherosclerosis (AS).\nHF, high fat diet; NC, normal chow diet; HC, high cholesterol diet; LDLc, LDL-cholesterol; HDLc, HDL-cholesterol; TC, total cholesterol; NS, non-significant; AS, atherosclerosis.\nFIGURE 2.\n\nAnti-atherosclerotic effects of rapamycin and its molecular targets.

Impaired endothelial function is an initiating event in the formation of AS (Roth et al., 2015). RAPA can improve endothelial function through regulating NO expression. Shear stress can affect the production of NO via the shear stress-responsive eNOS promoter, and low-stress regions are prone to AS (Cheng et al., 2008). In carotid arteries of mice fed normal- or high-cholesterol diet, RAPA modulates shear stress-induced NO production. RAPA can upregulate intracellular eNOS expression at low and normalshear-stress levels induced by carotid cast placement, an observation that indicates that the administration of RAPA can retard the onset of AS at AS-prone sites through increasing NO production (Cheng et al., 2008). Additionally, Trapp and Weis (2005) have reported that RAPA increased the production of NO in endothelial cells dose-dependently in vitro. Even in hypoxia, when NO production is greatly reduced, RAPA can increase the production of NO in endothelial cells. On the other hand, endothelin-1 is released by endothelial cells, which promotes vasoconstriction and enhances the adhesion of immune cells to endothelial cells. RAPA can decrease the production of endothelin-1 dose-dependently, thereby inhibiting the vasoconstriction of endothelial cells (Guo et al., 2014). Thus, RAPA can promote vasorelaxation through increasing NO production and inhibiting vasoconstriction of endothelial cells through targeting cytokine secretion.\nIn addition to endothelial impairment, monocyte recruitment is the hallmark of early AS. Recent evidence has also demonstrated that RAPA reduces adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. The migration of monocytes is increased after exposure of stromal cell-derived factor-1, a chemoattractant for monocyte recruitment. Pretreatment of monocytes with RAPA can inhibit this chemotaxis dose-dependently. This activity of RAPA is consistent with the results of an in vivo study in which macrophage numbers in plaque were decreased in RAPA-fed atherogenic mice (Pakala et al., 2005). Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 also participates in recruiting monocytes. RAPA has been found to attenuate monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression in the aortic arch of apoE-deficient mice fed an atherogenic diet, a finding that illustrates that RAPA has anti-migratory effects on macrophages (Castro et al., 2004). Additionally, RAPA can dose-dependently decrease the ox-LDL-induced expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin and inhibit the adhesion of monocytes to human umbilical vein-endothelial cells through suppressing the activation of MTORC2, and then inhibiting PKC phosphorylation and c-fos expression (Sun et al., 2017). Moreover, TNF-α, an inflammatory cytokine, can drive adhesion molecule expression through activating the Raf-1-Merk1/2-ERK1/2 pathway (Roberts and Der, 2007). It has been reported that RAPA can reduce increased TNF-a-induced expression of VCAM-1 by inhibiting the mTORC2-AKT-Raf-1-Merk1/2-ERK1/2 pathway in human umbilical vein-endothelial cells (Wang et al., 2014). However, RAPA had no effect on adhesion molecules expressed in human macrovascular and microvascular endothelial cells, which seems to contradict results of the above phenomenon (Lehle et al., 2008); the inconsistent results might be due to variations in physiological properties of the above three types of endothelial cells.\nModulating the Phenotypic Switch of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells\nFollowing the endothelial injury, VSMCs carry out a phenotypic transition from differentiation to de-differentiation and migrate to the sub-endothelial layer, where they and proliferate quickly, forming neointima. RAPA inhibits the de-differentiation of VSMCs through inhibiting mTOR and S6K1, resulting in changes in cellular contractile morphology and increased waf-1 and p27kip, a reaction that results in cell-cycle withdrawal (Ma et al., 2007). In a relevant in vitro study (Martin et al., 2004), RAPA prompted VSMCs to assume a contractile phenotype by inducing α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), calponin, and SM-MHC at the mRNA and protein levels through targeting S6K1. Also, in freshly excised swine femoral arteries, the contractile protein series, previously down-regulated by normal organ culture, was reversed after treatment with RAPA (Ding et al., 2011). Additionally, during the phenotypic transition of VSMCs, various growth factors or receptors, such as PDGF, IGF, and FGFR, are involved. When VSMCs are incubated with PDGF (Pan et al., 2017), RAPA can inhibit the proliferation and migratory effects of VSMCs together with increasing α-SMA and calponin and downregulating osteopontin protein; IGF is universally distributed in the blood serum, and the IGF-I receptor can be expressed in insulin-sensitive tissue and VSMCs. After binding with IGF, the IGF-I receptor can activate the PI3K-Akt pathway, which is a critical mechanism for maintaining the contractile phenotype of VSMCs (Ohkawa et al., 2003). RAPA can enhance the contractile protein expression via the IGF-I-PI3K-AKT pathway. FGFR1, as the major form of FGFR with its downstream signaling pathway, participates in VSMCs phenotypic switching through modulating contractile marker gene expression. FRS2 acts as a downstream modulator of the FGFR-1 pathway and, after FGFR-1 binds with FGF, FGFR-1 combines with FRS2 to form FGFR-1/FRS2 complex. The complex combines with mTOR to form multi-protein composites, followed by the activation of mTOR, and inhibits the contractile marker expression. RAPA can reverse FGFR-1/FRS2/mTOR complex-mediated downregulated expression of the contractile marker gene (Chen and Friesel, 2009).\nHyaluronan, a major element of extracellular matrix, can modulate local inflammatory responses, monocyte-VSMC adhesion, and proliferation and migration of VSMCs (Chung et al., 2002). RAPA can decrease the amount of hyaluronan secreted by VSMCs without accelerating the degradation rate of hyaluronan by decreasing the expression of hyaluronan synthase 1, 2 and 3 (Goueffic et al., 2007). In addition, RAPA-reduced hyaluronan synthesis may abolish the recruitment and retention of circulating monocytes after angioplasty, as hyaluronan can attract monocytes into inflamed tissues and promote differentiation of the cells. On the other hand, the increased proliferation of VSMCs can promote intimal hyperplasia and restenosis. The inflammatory mediator interferon (IFN)-γ has pro-AS effects, partly through promoting intimal hypertrophy and proliferation of VSMCs (Koh et al., 2004). The responsible mechanism may be induction of S6K1 phosphorylation by IFN-γ through activation of PI3K (Wang et al., 2007). RAPA can inhibit IFN-γ-mediated neointimal formation and proliferation of VSMCs by diminishing the phosphorylation of S6K1 (Wang et al., 2007). Also, VEGF can induce the proliferation of VSMCs, which have a pro-AS effect (Wang et al., 2007). RAPA has attenuated secretion of VEGF in VSMCs, thereby inhibiting the VSMC proliferation (Dichtl et al., 2006). All the above effects facilitate RAPA-mediated anti-proliferative effects in VSMCs. The above mechanisms are summarized in Figure 3.\n\nRapamycin inhibits the de-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Rapamycin suppresses the de-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells by inhibiting the activation of mTOR and S6K1, activating PI3K/AKT pathways, inhibiting PDGF pathway and the formation of FGFR-1/FRS2/mTOR complex. In addition, rapamycin inhibits the synthesis of hyaluronan through decreasing HAS and the secretion of VEGF.

Decreasing the uptake, enhancing the degradation of ox-LDL in these cellular types is a potent mechanism for inhibiting the development of AS. In endothelial cells, 70% of ox-LDL uptake was found regulated by LOX-1. OX-LDL can induce the expression of LOX-1 through activating the NF-κB pathway and enhancing the engulfment of OX-LDL in endothelial cells (Ling et al., 1997). These effects can be reversed by RAPA, as RAPA can reduce the endocytosis of OX-LDL in endothelial cells through inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation and then decreasing IκBα phosphorylation and cellular-nuclear accumulation of P65, thereby suppressing the expression of LOX-1 (Zhou et al., 2016). RAPA can also down-regulate the expression of SR-BI, which is also required for endothelial cell-mediated OX-LDL and HDL uptake, through inhibiting mTORC1 activity (Fruhwurth et al., 2014).\nOn the other hand, RAPA can also modulate the processes of cholesterol uptake and efflux in macrophage. In the THP-1 cell line, SR-A and SR-BII were down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner by RAPA at the mRNA level, regardless of the duration of stimulation. CD36 and LOX-1 are especially down-regulated by high-dose RAPA stimulation over an extended period, but not in a dose- or time-dependent manner. Moreover, low-dose RAPA can increase the transcriptional level of LXRα time-dependently. High-dose RAPA can decrease PPAR-γ expression; however, this effect is attenuated over an extended time. ABCA1 expression was enhanced by a low dose of RAPA at all time periods; however, a high dose of RAPA over a long time resulted in an undetectable level of ABCA1 (Mathis et al., 2007). Also, activation of LXRα can partly induce expression of CCR7, which is needed during transport of cholesterol out of atherosclerotic plaque (Feig et al., 2010). SIRT1 can activate LXR and inhibit the NF-κB pathway, thereby performing its anti-atherogenic role (Zeng et al., 2013). RAPA can activate the SIRT1/LXR/CCR7 pathway in the U937 cell line, thereby inhibiting foam-cell formation and promoting foam-cell egress. Furthermore, by increasing SIRT1, which can inhibit activation of NF-κB, RAPA can decrease the activity of NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB decreases ABCA1 and LXRα expression, which contributes to accumulation of lipid in macrophages (Zheng et al., 2017). Moreover, the TLR4-mediated pathway can promote the formation of macrophage-derived foam cells by inhibiting the LXR pathway and ABCA1. After treating THP-1 with OX-LDL, the expression of TLR4 was markedly enhanced, mediated by the phosphorylation of mTOR and elevated p70-S6K levels in foam cells. RAPA can block the increased TLR4 induced by OX-LDL and reverse the decreased ABCA1 induced by TLR4 when its ligands are bound, thereby enhancing cholesterol efflux (Yu et al., 2011).\nRapamycin can inhibit the formation of VSMCs-derived foam cells. Their lipid content can be increased through increased LDL receptor-guided LDL uptake or reduced ABCA1-guided cholesterol efflux, induced by inflammatory cytokines. RAPA can decrease the increased expression of LDL and VLDL receptors, increased by IL-1β, resulting in a reduction of intracellular lipid contents in VSMCs. In addition, RAPA enhanced cholesterol efflux and reversed decreased cholesterol efflux in the inflammatory environment caused by IL-1β via elevating ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression (Ma et al., 2007). Moreover, RAPA can attenuate the expression of IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, which can promote foam-cell formation (Ma et al., 2007). RAPA cannot only decrease the uptake of LDL by VSMCs, it can inhibit cellular cholesterol synthesis, which is enhanced by inflammatory stress. Cholesterol synthesis is limited by a key enzyme, HMGR. When synthesis is demanded, SREBPs are transported via SCAP from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and activated by SCAP in the Golgi, followed by translocation into the nucleus and binding with the promoter of HMGR. In this circumstance, cholesterol synthesis is activated. When cholesterol is overloaded in cells, the insulin-induced gene, a membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, connects with SCAP to inhibit the activation of SREBPs, which form a feedback loop for cholesterol homeostasis. In addition, the insulin-induced gene mediates HMGR degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Normal function of the feedback loop is essential for inhibiting foam-cell formation. With inflammatory stimulation, such as with IL-1β, the feedback loop is disrupted and cholesterol synthesis in VSMCs is increased. In the presence or absence of IL-1β, RAPA can inhibit cholesterol synthesis in VSMCs through sequentially downregulating the expression of SCAP, SREBP-2, and HMGR, upregulating Insigs, and decreasing nuclear translocation of SREBP-2/SCAP composite (Ma et al., 2010). Thus, foam cells derived from VSMCs can be inhibited by RAPA through targeting cholesterol uptake, efflux and synthesis. The above mechanisms are summarized in Figure 4.\n\nRapamycin inhibits the formation of foam cells derived from endothelial cell, macrophage and VSMC. Rapamycin suppresses the foam cells by inhibiting the activation of mTOR, SR-BI in endothelial cells. It decreases macrophage-derived foam cells by inhibiting LOX-1, SR-A, SR-BII, CD36, TLR4 and enhancing the expression of LXR, SIRT1, and ABCA1. In addition, it decreases VSMC-derived foam cells by elevating the decreased ABCA1 induced by IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and downregulating the increased LDLR and VLDLR. And rapamycin can also decrease cholesterol synthesis. The solid lines with arrow indicate increase or activation, and lines without arrows indicate decrease or suppression.

RAPA can ameliorate cellular innate inflammatory responses. Pathogen-associated molecules derived from bacteria, viruses or fungi, can bind with TLR4, leading to triggering of the inflammation cascade. RAPA can down-regulate inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-a, in THP-1 macrophages treated with LPS (Varghese et al., 2005). Additionally, in the proinflammatory pathway, NF-κB, a transcription factor, is a main mediator of cytokine secretion to promote inflammation and recruit other immune cells in AS. RAPA can decrease NF-κB activity, possibly through increasing SIRT1, which is characterized by decreased levels of NF-κB in the nucleus and its downstream target, TNF-α (Zheng et al., 2017). On the other hand, RAPA can suppress the proliferation of T-cells that may contribute to AS, and both T helper type 1 and T helper type 2 cytokine production are decreased by treatment with RAPA. Moreover, RAPA can increase mRNA expression of TGF-β, which retards the proliferation of T cells (Dumont and Su, 1996). Mechanistically, RAPA attenuates cell-cycle advancement through inhibitory regulation of the CKI p27kipa. In another study, RAPA has been demonstrated to increase the expansion of Treg cells, a finding that indicates that RAPA can modulate the adaptive immune response to inhibit AS (Potekhina et al., 2011).\nInhibiting Cellular Senescence and Apoptosis\nCellular senescence and apoptosis have been commonly observed in advanced lesions and can increase plaque vulnerability. It is well established that senescent VSMCs have impaired self-repairing ability, which reduces fibrous cap content (Luo Z. et al., 2017). OX-LDL can induce the senescence of VSMCs, and SA-β-gal, p16 and p21 have been found increased in senescence VSMCs. RAPA decreased SA-β-gal, p16 and p21 expression in VSMCs, an activity that indicates that RAPA attenuates cellular senescence increased by OX-LDL (Luo Z. et al., 2017).\nThe apoptosis of macrophage and VSMCs induces plaque vulnerability in advanced plaque (Clarke et al., 2006). The apoptosis rate of macrophage-derived foam cells varies with cellular stage, which is determined by the duration of stimulation with OX-LDL. In THP-1 treated with OX-LDL, foam-cell assay was performed at 6 and 48 h, which represent early and late stages of foam-cell formation (Liu et al., 2016). At both times, the intracellular lipid content was significantly increased, and the transformation of LC3I to LC3II was upregulated. Foam cells at late stage are prone to apoptosis because of increased oxidative stress, but upon treatment with RAPA, the viability of late-stage cells is increased (Liu et al., 2016). Also, in the same paper, after feeding mice with a RAPA-included western diet for 16 weeks, aortic lesions had a lower apoptotic cell profile than that did controls, and the predominant cell type that colocalized with autophagy markers was macrophage (Liu et al., 2016). These results indicate that RAPA can prevent plaque advancement of AS and enhance plaque stability through repressing the apoptosis rate of foam cells at various stages. Mechanistically, RAPA decreases apoptosis through suppressing the production of ROS, which promote cellular apoptosis, thereby inhibiting creation of mitochondria-derived superoxide.\nStimulating Autophagy\nAutophagy is a cellular protective process, in which damaged intracellular elements, such as dysfunctional mitochondria, proteins, and lipid droplets, are eliminated, a process that contributes to cellular balance and self-adaptation (Yang and Klionsky, 2010). Autophagy has been classified into three categories: Microautophagy, macroautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (De Meyer et al., 2015). The main steps of macroautophagy are autophagosome formation, cargo segregation, and, finally, lysosomal fusion/degradation. Impaired macroautophagy can lead to inflammatory diseases, such as AS (Levine et al., 2011). In advanced AS, dysfunctional macroautophagy can make cells vulnerable to apoptotic stimuli and impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, which accelerates plaque progression (De Meyer et al., 2015; Grootaert et al., 2018). Therefore, interest in agents that can stimulate autophagy has increased, and RAPA has been found to have macroautophagy-stimulating effects (Adelman, 2010). In the constricted carotid artery of ApoE-/- mice, created by collar surgery, oral administration of RAPA increased the formation of autophagosomes and activated autophagy, thereby diminishing plaque development; the responsible mechanism is: RAPA increases miRNA-155 expression, thereby promoting the activation of autophagy, which retards the development of atherosclerotic plaques (Ma et al., 2017). Moreover, low-dose RAPA, as a moderate stimulator of autophagy, can reverse the decreased VSMC autophagy induced by OX-LDL through inducing increased autophagosome and elevated expressions of LC3II. In this process, activated mTORC1 can induce the phosphorylation of Unc-51-like autophagy, thus activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and repressing ULK1 and ATG13 expression; through these actions, ULK1/ATG13 complex-induced autophagy is inhibited. After RAPA treatment, MTORC1, ULK1 total content, and phosphorylated ULK1 were decreased, and ATG13 was upregulated, whereby VSMCs autophagy survival was enhanced (Luo Z. et al., 2017). Intriguingly, with increased doses of RAPA, its anti-AS effects were not increased, which implies that moderate autophagy induced by low-dose RAPA – without inducing excessive autophagy – may be optimal for treatment of AS.\nOn the other hand, induced by OX-LDL, autophagy in endothelial cells is increased, and autophagosomes and autolysosomes are formed, followed by an infusion with lysosome, by which OX-LDL is degraded. RAPA can enhance the elevated autophagy level induced by OX-LDL and decrease the accumulation of OX-LDL in endothelial cells within a certain period, thereby protecting cells against apoptosis and other damage induced by OX-LDL (Zhang et al., 2010). An in vitro study has also demonstrated that RAPA increased the co-localization of OX-LDL and autophagy-related proteins, such as LC3 and LAMP1. Also, p62 expression can be down-regulated by RAPA, an action that indicates that RAPA drives autophagic flux. Simultaneously, LAMP1 protein is up-regulated by RAPA, an action that implies fusing of lysosomes with autophagic vacuoles (Zhang et al., 2015). In summary, RAPA can activate the autophagy-lysosome pathway to accelerate the degradation of OX-LDL in endothelial cells. However, after continual stimulation with OX-LDL, RAPA does not affect the endothelial content of OX-LDL, possibly because excessive OX-LDL can damage the autophagic degradation of itself (through interfering with the fusion between lysosomes and autophagosomes).\nInhibiting Platelet Activation\nPlatelet activation and the ensuing thrombosis are responsible for undesirable outcomes, such as acute myocardial infarction or stroke, in advanced AS. In advanced atherosclerotic plaque, where rupture of the plaque and thrombosis often occur, macrophages can express tissue factor, a procoagulant molecule that triggers thrombosis and is increased by inflammatory-related stimulation (Ollivier et al., 2005). RAPA has anti-coagulant activities. Treating THP-1 and human circulating monocytes under LPS stimulation with RAPA can lead to a significant decrease in transcriptional level of tissue factor, thereby inhibiting tissue factor-antigen content and cell-surface-derived or total-tissue-generated procoagulant activity. RAPA inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of the two complexes, p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65, to the tissue factor promoter site, thereby inhibiting tissue-factor activity. On the other hand, enhanced secretion of the tissue-factor pathway inhibitor induced by LPS in THP-1 cells was moderately inhibited by RAPA (Ollivier et al., 2005). The above effects lead to the reduction of platelet activation by RAPA.\nClinical Application of Rapamycin in Atherosclerosis\nSirolimus-eluting stents, the first drug-eluting stent approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, were widely used in treating AS lesions at coronary and other peripheral arteries. The stents were used in the treatment of de novo AS lesions, graft stenosis, and in-stent restenosis, and they had better outcomes than did PTA or other stents. The randomized controlled clinical trials comparing SES and other stents or PTA are tabulated in Table 2.\nTable 2.\nRandomized controlled clinical trials comparing SES and other stents or PTA in the past 10 years.\nSES, sirolimus-eluting stent; PTA, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; BMS, bare metal stent.\nRapamycin in de novo Lesions\nSirolimus-eluting stents have advantages over PTA, standard stent or other drug-eluting stents for treatment of de novo lesions. For coronary lesions, it has been reported in a randomized controlled study (Morice et al., 2002) that, in-stent restenosis, repeated revascularization rates and long-term lumen loss were lower in patients who underwent interposition of SES than in those who were treated with standard stents. On the other hand, in below-the-knee atherosclerotic lesions, application of SES can contribute more to lower in-stent restenosis and target-lesion revascularization than do standard stents or PTA in randomized controlled studies (Falkowski et al., 2009; Rastan et al., 2011; Katsanos et al., 2016). Another randomized, multicenter study also demonstrates that at a mean follow-up of 33 months, compared to bare metal stents, SES improved Rutherford-Becker class, long-term event-free survival and amputation rates, but they did not significantly change target-lesion revascularization after being used to treat focal below-the-knee AS (Rastan et al., 2012). Moreover, in another randomized study (Scheinert et al., 2012), a 12-month follow-up found lower in-stent restenosis and greater vessel patency but no significant change in target-lesion revascularization, limb amputation rate, or Rutherford class level with SES versus PTA for symptomatic infrapopliteal lesions. That study also found that event-free survival was significantly higher with SES than with PTA, and SES-treated patients had a better rate of wound healing, health-associated quality-of-life scores, and quality-adjusted life-years at 12 months. Also, a 5-year retrospective analysis of SES -treated chronic below-the-knee lesions (Rutherford categories 3–6) found that although Rutherford classification and vascular patency had decreased significantly at follow-up, the patency rate was 83.8% and Rutherford class level had improved in 92% of the patients with critical limb ischemia. These results have encouraged longer follow-up with SES treatment of critical limb ischemia in patients with below-the-knee lesions (Werner et al., 2012). However, for superficial femoral artery lesions, a randomized, double-blinded, multi-center study demonstrated that at 6 and 24 months’ follow-up, SES had no significant advantage over bare metal stents in relief of symptoms, rates of restenosis, ankle-brachial indices and target-lesion revascularization rate (Duda et al., 2002, 2006). These findings indicated that the effects of SES vary among vessel segments, although these stents had favorable results after intermediate or long duration.\nSirolimus-eluting stents have advantages over other drug-eluting stents, with less in-stent restenosis and target-lesion revascularization. The commonly used agents for coating stents include sirolimus and paclitaxel. A multi-center trial found that SES and paclitaxel have similar target-lesion revascularization. At 12-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in major adverse cardiac events or stent thrombosis between the two groups (Lee et al., 2010). In another randomized controlled comparison of SES and paclitaxel in treating coronary lesions, in a follow-up of 10 years, SES had a lower rate of in-stent restenosis and target-lesion revascularization than did paclitaxel (Yamaji et al., 2016). The inconsistent results may be attributed to variation in patient or lesion characteristics. Therefore, updated meta-analysis studies should be performed to determine the long-term outcome of SES treatment compared with control treatment.\nRapamycin in Restenosis Lesions\nSaphenous vein graft interposition is commonly performed with coronary artery bypass grafting. However, the incidence of graft restenosis is significant, and restenosis often necessitates repeated revascularization (Goldman et al., 2004). Endovascular procedures with stent implantation can also be accompanied by a significant rate of restenosis. SES can be used in graft or in-stent restenosis. It has been reported that bare metal stents or PTA have a high restenosis rate compared with that of SES in treating saphenous vein graft lesions (Brilakis et al., 2009). Moreover, in a cohort of 273 patients with 364 coronary lesions, including graft or in-stent restenosis, SES were used, and the mean 24-month follow-up revealed rates of binary restenosis, target-lesion revascularization and stent thrombosis of 5.5, 4.7, and 0.3%, respectively, which are lower than those reported with bare metal stents (Ino et al., 2009).\nThe Main Challenge to the Application of Rapamycin\nThe clinical application of RAPA can be accompanied by side effects that limit the routine application of RAPA in patients with AS. The most frequent complication is hyperlipidemia, which may develop in transplant patients treated with RAPA (Kniepeiss et al., 2004). The elevated lipid profiles caused by RAPA may accelerate the formation of AS. The explanation for the hyperlipidemia may be that RAPA suppresses LDL receptor expression in the liver, thereby elevating blood cholesterol and apoproteins concentration and promoting hepatic secretion of triglycerides (Andres et al., 2006). Another study (Otsuka et al., 2015) demonstrated dose-dependent hyperlipidemia induced by RAPA, which could be managed well with postoperative statin therapy. Therefore, a lipid-lowering regimen and lower dosage of RAPA may be needed for patients being treated with RAPA. Other unwanted effects of RAPA are: (1) Inhibitory effects of endothelial progenitor cell-induced re-endothelization, which may cause late stent thrombosis and sudden death. Endothelial progenitor cells, differentiated from circulating MNCs, can repair damaged endothelial cells, thereby promoting re-endothelization (Kalka et al., 2000). RAPA inhibits the differentiation of MNCs into endothelial progenitor cells and promotes the senescence of these cells through suppressing telomerase activity. Several clinical studies have indicated that the use of SES may moderately increase the rate of late stent thrombosis (Daemen et al., 2007; Stone et al., 2007). (2) Delayed re-endothelization via inhibition of VEGF expression and the proliferation of resident endothelial cells (Imanishi et al., 2006), promotes acute stent thrombosis, which is a common early adverse event in stent angioplasty. (3) Vasoconstriction at juxta-SES-implanted coronary segments, which results in the formation of AS in non-target vessels. In evaluating the endothelial function influenced by SES or bare metal stents, vasoconstriction induced by acetylcholine provocation test, as a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction, is elevated at juxta-SES-implanted coronary segments compared with that in the juxta-bare metal stents coronary segment in patients with multiple lesions (Mischie et al., 2013). This finding implies that RAPA may trigger the AS cascade, as impaired endothelial cell function initiates the formation of AS adjacent to the stented vascular segments (Bonetti et al., 2003), with more in-stent restenosis at the edge of SES. This result rules out individual variation because the vasoconstrictive effect occurs at different vascular segments in the same patient. Overall, these adverse effects can offset the promising advantages of RAPA in treating AS lesions.\nIn advanced atherosclerotic plaque, overactivation of autophagy commonly occurs, which results in elevated cell death or apoptosis. Excessive autophagy stimulation or defective autophagy is a deterrent to treating AS because it can have unexpected adverse events. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that the vulnerability of various cells to external injury is increased under the above-mentioned autophagy conditions (Jung et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2012). Therefore, the adequate dosage of RAPA used to prevent AS formation or in-stent or graft restenosis should be determined with pharmacological dynamic studies of the optimal blood RAPA concentration achieved with various delivery methods and dosages of the drug.

As multiple independent studies have successfully reproduced the lifespan and healthspan promoting effects of rapamycin, the focus has shifted to possible translational use. While a promising compound, clinical use of rapamycin is limited by concerns of side effects associated with the drug. Studies aimed at defining optimal dosage regimen, delivery route, and formulation will allow for benefits to be maximized while reducing side effects.\nKeywords: mTOR, target of rapamycin, healthspan, mitochondria, mitochondria disease\nRapamycin is a leading candidate compound for promoting healthy longevity by targeting aging. Since 2009, more than a dozen independent studies have reported both lifespan and healthspan benefits from rapamycin treatment in mice [1]. Given these impressive results, attention has naturally shifted to potential translational applications. These include clinical trials assessing the impact of rapamycin in enhancing vaccine response in geriatric patients and on cardiac function in domestic dogs [2, 3].\nDespite the promise of rapamycin (sirolimus) and related compounds (referred to as rapamycins or rapalogs), side effects are a major concern that could limit their application in clinical geroscience. Patients taking rapamycins to prevent organ transplant rejection have presented with adverse effects including stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, high serum triglycerides and cholesterol, and impaired wound healing [4]. Doses used to extend lifespan in mice are generally free from these side effects; however, lifespan-prolonging doses of rapamycin may result in a different set of adverse effects in mice, including altered glucose homeostasis (by glucose tolerance test), gonadal atrophy, and increased incidence of cataracts [5].\nFigure 1. Maximizing the benefits of rapamycin.\n\nRapamycin is associated with positive outcomes and side effects which both increase with dose. Optimization of dosage regimen, drug delivery route, and formulation may provide maximum benefits while reducing off-target effects. In the setting of diseases, such as mitochondrial disease, the benefits of rapamycin may outweigh the side effects even at high dose.\nMoving forward, we believe an emphasis should be placed on understanding how to achieve maximal efficacy from rapamycin treatment while minimizing side effects. In this context, limited evidence based consideration of dosing and duration of treatment represents a major limitation in most preclinical studies. The vast majority of aging studies, in particular, have utilized an encapsulated form of rapamycin (eRAPA) provided in murine chow at 14 parts per million (ppm). Only one published study has provided even a partial dose response, finding that when treatment was initiated at 9 months of age, 42 ppm eRAPA resulted in a greater magnitude of lifespan extension compared to 14 ppm, while 4.6 ppm resulted in a smaller effect [6]. Other regimens, such as administering rapamycin for two weeks each month [7] or once every five days [8], have also extended lifespan, but the relative effects among studies are difficult to interpret due to differences in strain, treatment duration, mode of delivery, and an absence of pharmacokinetic or biochemical analyses. Likewise, although short-term treatment with rapamycin can improve at least some age-associated functional measures [1], it remains unclear whether transient treatment is sufficient to recapitulate a majority of rapamycin's benefits, including longevity.\nWe recently set out to begin addressing the relationship between the dose of rapamycin, mode of delivery, and functional efficacy in a mouse model of severe mitochondrial disease. The Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mouse model of Leigh syndrome is deficient in complex I of the electron transport chain and presents many features of the human disease including progressive necrotizing encephalopathy, retarded growth, lactic acidosis, and greatly reduced life expectancy. We had previously shown that daily intraperitoneal (IP) injection of rapamycin at 8 mg/kg/day dramatically attenuates disease progression and enhances survival by more than 100% [9]. More recently, we tested a range of dietary eRAPA concentrations in this mouse model, finding that lower amounts of the drug comparable to those tested for effects on lifespan in wild type mice had no effect in the KO mice [10]. Instead, much higher levels of eRAPA or IP rapamycin were needed to attenuate disease and increase survival. Based on relative phenotypic outcomes in both the KO and wild type mice, as well as serum concentrations of the drug, we conclude that dietary eRAPA must be provided at approximately 27-fold higher levels than has been commonly used (378 ppm) in order to achieve similar biological activity to daily injection of 8 mg/kg. In addition, 14 ppm eRAPA had little impact on developmental growth rate in control or diseased mice, a phenotypic readout of rapamycin activity, while higher doses robustly reduced growth. While eRAPA and injected rapamycin are not directly comparable, as the delivery methods will have different pharmacokinetic parameters and may result in dramatically different tissue distributions, these results provide an initial foray into examination of dosing and delivery of rapamycin in a preclinical model of a medically relevant class of disease.\nIn ongoing unpublished studies we have begun examining of the effects of transient rapamycin treatment on lifespan, healthspan, and side effects in wild type mice. These studies are being performed using both IP injection and dietary eRAPA in two different strain backgrounds. Due to resource constraints we are, by necessity, limited to a small number of potential conditions, but our hope is that these experiments will provide insight into effects of short-term rapamycin treatment, including post-treatment life expectancy and health parameters. If transient treatment recapitulates some or all of the benefits of continuous treatment, it may provide a strategy for reducing side effects while maintaining efficacy.\nAn additional consideration for ongoing studies are the important sex-dependent differences in the magnitude of effect of rapamycin on biological outcomes, including lifespan, with female mice generally showing a larger effect than males at lower doses of the drug. Our dose-response studies suggest that the differential impact of rapamycin on male and female mice is primarily a result of greater sensitivity of females to rapamycin, with higher doses attenuating gender differences in the phenotypic outcomes we have examined so far. Further studies, particularly at higher doses of the drug, will be required to definitively answer this question.\nIn summary, while remarkable beneficial impact of rapamycin on longevity and disease have now been firmly established in mice, additional studies are needed to define the relative importance of dose, delivery method, and treatment regimen. These studies are critically important for successful translation to human biology, both for understanding how to optimize beneficial effects, but equally importantly, for reducing adverse outcomes.\nAcknowledgments\nSCJ is supported by NIH grant F32AG050444.

Results from mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease have shown beneficial effects of rapamycin, including preventing or reversing cognitive deficits, reducing amyloid oligomers and tauopathies and normalizing synaptic plasticity and cerebral glucose uptake. The “Evaluating Rapamycin Treatment in Alzheimer’s Disease using Positron Emission Tomography” (ERAP) trial aims to test if these results translate to humans through evaluating the change in cerebral glucose uptake following six months of rapamycin treatment in participants with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease.\nMethods\nERAP is a six-month-long, single-arm, open-label, phase IIa biomarker-driven study evaluating if the drug rapamycin can be repurposed to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Fifteen patients will be included and treated with a weekly dose of 7 mg rapamycin for six months. The primary endpoint will be change in cerebral glucose uptake, measured using [18F]FDG positron emission tomography. Secondary endpoints include changes in cognitive measures, markers in cerebrospinal fluid as well as cerebral blood flow measured using magnetic resonance imaging. As exploratory outcomes, the study will assess change in multiple age-related pathological processes, such as periodontal inflammation, retinal degeneration, bone mineral density loss, atherosclerosis and decreased cardiac function.\nDiscussion\nThe ERAP study is a clinical trial using in vivo imaging biomarkers to assess the repurposing of rapamycin for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. If successful, the study would provide a strong rationale for large-scale evaluation of mTOR-inhibitors as a potential disease-modifying treatment in Alzheimer’s disease.\nTrial registration\nClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06022068, date of registration 2023–08-30.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12883-024-03596-1.\nKeywords: Rapamycin, Sirolimus, Alzheimer’s disease, Clinical trial, PET, MRI, CT, OCT, Geroprotection, Aging\nBackground\nFor many decades, the “amyloid hypothesis” has been the dominant scientific lead in understanding and treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical trials that directly target amyloid plaques (such as amyloid antibodies) have however resulted in mixed success [1]. Only recently have two amyloid antibodies been given accelerated approval by the FDA. The drugs are prohibitively priced and questions about their efficacy and safety profile remain [2]. It is therefore crucial to explore new scientific approaches to find an efficient disease-modifying intervention. One such approach is to focus on the single largest risk factor for AD: advancing age.\nIt is estimated that the risk of developing AD doubles every five years over the age of 65 [3], and the risk of death from AD increases by about 700 times between the ages of 55 and 85 [4]. Within the field of geroscience, which focuses on the biology of aging, an increasing number of interventions have been shown to enhance the lifespan of model organisms and slow down or prevent age-related pathology [5]. One promising approach to understand and treat age-related diseases like AD is to study the effects of such interventions; defined as “geroprotective compounds”, in humans [6]. Pre-clinical data suggest that the drug rapamycin is a promising candidate for this purpose [6, 7].\nRapamycin, also known as sirolimus, is an immunosuppressive drug which has been in clinical use for more than two decades. In mice, treatment with rapamycin increases average lifespan by 10 to 15% [8]. The drug has also been shown to increase healthspan in model organisms by delaying the onset of age-related diseases [9]. For example, preclinical data support a beneficial effect of rapamycin (or its analogues) on periodontitis [10], retinal pathologies [11, 12], atherosclerosis [13, 14]; cardiac dysfunction [15, 16], and bone mass loss [17, 18]. Such diseases are commonly manifested with increasing age and are considered frequent comorbidities to AD [19–31].\nThere is a large body of preclinical data suggesting that repurposing rapamycin to treat AD could be effective [6, 7]. In several independent mice models of AD, rapamycin has been shown to prevent and reverse cognitive deficits [32, 33], reduce amyloid oligomers and tauopathies [34, 35], normalize synaptic plasticity [36], cerebral glucose uptake and [33] vascular cognitive impairment [37]. Additionally, in transgenic rodent models of AD, rapamycin has demonstrated neuroprotective effects by restoring blood–brain barrier function [32] and improving neurovascular coupling [38].\nDespite promising preclinical data supporting rapamycin as an effective agent in alleviating or reversing AD pathology, no large-scale human clinical studies have been initiated. Currently, only one phase II trial is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04629495).\nConducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with symptom ratings (such as cognitive ability) as endpoints is challenging due to the need for large sample sizes and high costs. An alternative approach is to assess the impact of candidate interventions on AD biomarkers before initiating such large-scale RCTs. By focusing on well-established and precise biomarkers of the disease rather than symptom ratings, evidence of slowing or even reversal of pathology can be obtained with much smaller sample sizes [39, 40].\nThe purpose of the study “Evaluating rapamycin treatment in Alzheimer’s disease using positron emission tomography” (ERAP) is to assess the effect of rapamycin in treating early-stage AD. This will be done by measuring changes in biomarkers using in vivo imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as biomarker changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We will test the hypothesis that rapamycin can reverse AD-associated brain pathologies, resulting primarily in an increase in neuronal glucose metabolism, and secondarily in an improved cerebral blood flow and a decrease in tau and amyloid protein aggregates in the CSF. We will also record the occurrence of adverse events and investigate pharmacokinetic properties of the drug. Further, we aim to explore the effect of rapamycin on other age-related pathologies in the body using different imaging techniques to assess changes in i) periodontal inflammation, ii) retinal structures, iii) bone mineral density, iv) atherosclerosis, as well as v) cardiac function. The results from this phase IIa trial will be used to inform on the feasibility of conducting a larger controlled trial in the future.\nMethods\nStudy design\nERAP is a single-centre, open-label, one-arm, phase IIa intervention study. Fifteen patients diagnosed with early-stage AD will be recruited from the Karolinska University Hospital, Medical Unit Aging Memory clinic, located in Solna, Stockholm, Sweden. The unit is a specialized outpatient clinic that examines individuals referred by general practitioners in primary and occupational health care in the northern catchment of Stockholm, as well as individuals younger than 70 years in the entire Stockholm region [41].\nFollowing baseline measurements, all participants will receive a weekly oral dose of 7 mg rapamycin (Tablet Rapamune®) for a duration of six months. Throughout the study, participants will be continuously monitored for safety and adverse events. By the end of the treatment period, follow-up measurements will be conducted. Figure 1 presents a schematic overview of the study timeline for each participant.\n\nStudy timeline for each participant\nParticipants\nThe study will enrol patients with early-stage AD, defined as fulfilling criteria for Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome, with either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type, according to the NIA-AA (National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer's Association) 2018 criteria [42] (see Table 1 for specific study eligibility criteria).\n\nEligibility criteria\nInclusion criteria\n  1.

The drug and structurally analogous compounds (known as “rapalogs”), such as everolimus, have been approved for the treatment of several solid tumours [44, 45], and is currently the only pharmacological option when treating tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) [46]. Rapamycin exerts its effect by inhibiting the intracellular protein kinase mTOR, which stands for “mechanistic target of rapamycin”. mTOR has been shown to be central in the regulation of several important functions in mammalian cells, such as cell growth and proliferation, protein synthesis, and autophagy [47].\nThe bioavailability of orally administered rapamycin is low (approximately 15%) and highly variable (SD = 9%). The drug is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4, with a terminal half-life of 62 h, though also here with large interindividual variability (SD = 16 h) [48].\nThe side effect profile of rapamycin is well known from a large number of clinical trials and from long clinical use. The treatment is generally well tolerated, but common side effects, as described in the product information [43] are; stomatitis, diarrhea, and nausea. Changes in clinical laboratory values observed during rapamycin treatment include increased blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, and bone marrow depression manifesting as thrombocytopenia and anemia. The incidence of bacterial infections has been reported as increased in cancer patients treated with rapamycin, along with reports of cases of non-infectious pneumonitis [44].\nNotably, the data on side effects is based on the use of rapamycin following organ transplantation, where the drug is commonly used together with other immunosuppressants. In the ERAP trial, we plan to deviate from the standard dosing of rapamycin in two ways. Typically, when used as an immunosuppressant, rapamycin is administered orally at a daily dose of 2 mg or above [43]. We will instead administer an overall lower dose but in an intermittent fashion; a weekly oral dose of 7 mg. This change is aimed at reducing the risk of adverse events. The rationale behind this is that positive effects of rapamycin are hypothesized to be caused by inhibition of the mTOR1 complex, while many of the side effects are hypothesized to be due to inhibition of the mTOR2 complex. While mTOR1 is sensitive to acute dosing treatment, mTOR2 requires sustained exposure of the drug to be effectively inhibited [45].\nPatients will be monitored for side effects during the study, including the collection of blood samples at follow-up visits (see Table 2). These samples will be analysed for standard clinical measures, including parameters known to be affected by rapamycin: complete blood count with differential and platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, albumin, creatinine, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, phosphorus, and creatine phosphokinase.\n\nVisits, follow-ups and their corresponding assessments/examinations\naFor the PET, MRI, and the OCT examinations, the order is interchangeable\nbPharmacokinetic testing will consist of a total of 4 blood samples per participant. Blood samples will be collected for determining the concentration of rapamycin as follows: within 1 h prior to administration of rapamycin, at 1 and 3 (± 30 min) hours post administration of rapamycin, and 48 h post administration\nc The first weekly dose of rapamycin will be taken on a weekday, after completing the baseline measurements. The treatment will last for 26 weeks (182 days)\ndIn the event that patients are included where the most recent lumbar puncture and/or blood tests and/or cognitive testing are > 9 months old, one additional visit will be planned for new measurements to function as baseline values\n The extent to which rapamycin crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in humans has not been thoroughly investigated. Rapamycin is a large molecule (molecular weight 914.2) and a substrate, albeit with low affinity, for the efflux pump P-glycoprotein [46]. Compounds with these properties are often considered unlikely to pass from intestine to blood and bind to an intracellular target [47]. It is however known, from long clinical use, that oral treatment with rapamycin in humans leads to intracellular mTOR inhibition. The molecule's ability to pass through cell membranes , likely facilitated by its high lipophilicity (logP estimated to be 4.3), supports its passage across the BBB despite its size .\n After oral administration, detectable levels of rapamycin have been found in the brains of rodents [49, 50], and a large number of studies show clear effects in the central nervous system of animals [7]. Support for cerebral target engagement (i.e. mTOR inhibition) in humans comes from the use of rapamycin as a first-line treatment for the cerebral manifestations of TSC [51]. TSC is a genetic disorder that activates the mTOR pathway, leading to the growth of benign tumors in various organs, including the brain. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin analogues is the only approved pharmacological treatment of the disease, and the only feasible mechanism of action is mTOR inhibition in cells behind the BBB.\nVisits and data collection\nTable 2 and Supplementary Information (Additional file 1) outline the study visits, follow-ups, and corresponding assessments. In brief, participants will be invited to a first screening visit accompanied by a study partner. During this visit, the study will be explained in detail and written informed consent will be obtained. Basic clinical and demographic information will be collected, and the study eligibility criteria will be assessed (see Table 1).\nBefore initiating the study treatment, the following baseline examinations will be performed: [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET/CT imaging, brain and head MR imaging, cardiological MR imaging, retinal optical coherence tomography, lumbar puncture for collection of a CSF sample, as well as neuropsychological testing and physical aptitude. At the end of the treatment period, the same set of follow-up examinations will be conducted.\n Throughout the treatment period, participants will attend three clinical follow-up visits. At every visit, information on side effects will be collected. During the second clinical follow-up, blood samples will be collected at four time points over 48 h to assess the drug’s pharmacokinetic properties (just before and 1,3, and 48 h after intake of the weekly dose). At the third clinical follow-up visit, which will occur after the final dose of the study drug, neuropsychological cognitive tests will be performed and a CSF sample will be collected. Additionally, participants will have at least two scheduled phone calls during the study to assess adverse events or changes in concomitant medications/supplements.\nObjectives and endpoints\nTable 3 presents the study objectives along with their respective outcomes and endpoints.\n\nStudy objectives and endpoints\nChange-from-baseline for:\n• [18F]FDG brain uptake, measured with PET\nChange-from-baseline for:\n• MoCA total score\n• CSF levels of amyloid beta, p-tau, and t-tau\n• Cerebral blood flow, measured with MRI using a non-invasive pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeling sequence\n• Physical performance:\n◦ Timed 10 m walking test\n◦ Timed 10 m dual-task test\n◦ 30 s chair stand test\n◦ Hand strength\n• Neuropsychological cognitive testing using:\n◦ Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (learning and delayed recall)\n◦ Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure\n◦ Hagman test\n◦ Trail Making Test A + B\n◦ Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th edition coding subtest to assess processing speed/attention\nWhole blood measurements of rapamycin concentration:\n◦ Cmax\n◦ Ctrough\n◦ Area under the curve\n To evaluate a general “geroprotective” effect of rapamycin treatment, by measuring changes in age-related tissue pathologies, such as:\n  • Periodontal associated inflammation\n  • Retinal degeneration\n  • Atherosclerosis in large arteries\n  • Heart function\n  • Myocardial inflammation\n  • Bone mineral density\nChange-from-baseline for:\n• Periodontal oedema and bone remodeling, measured using MRI and CT\n• Thickness and thickness ratios of retinal nerve fiber layers in the macula and optic disc, measured using OCT\n• Pulse wave velocity in the aorta, measured using MRI\n• [18F]FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques in large arteries\n• Heart function (including, but not limited to: diastolic function, microvascular function, myocardial-volume and strain), measured with MRI\n• Bone mineral density in lumbar vertebrae, measured using qCT\nPET Positron Emission Tomography, MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging, MoCA Montreal Cognitive Assessment, OCT Optical Coherence Tomography, qCT quantitative Computer Tomography, AE Adverse Event, SAE Severe Adverse Event\nThe primary objective of ERAP is to evaluate the effect of rapamycin on the progression of early-stage AD. The primary endpoint will be the change in [18F]FDG PET uptake in the cerebral grey matter between baseline and the end of the study. Multiple studies have demonstrated that cerebral glucose metabolism, assessed using [18F]FDG PET, declines progressively with normal aging and is further impaired in AD [52, 53]. Consequently, brain [18F]FDG uptake is commonly utilized as a diagnostic tool for AD and has served as a biomarker for disease progression when assessing the effectiveness of potential AD treatments [54].\nSecondary endpoints for assessing treatment efficacy will be change between baseline and end-of-study in cerebral grey matter perfusion (blood-flow) measured by MRI and a pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeling sequence; CSF levels of amyloid beta 42, phosphorylated tau and total tau; and change in the neuropsychological test the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score.\nThe safety and tolerability of intermittently dosed rapamycin in early-stage AD will be assessed. We will monitor and record the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AE), severe adverse events (SAE) through clinical follow-up examinations, where vital signs and blood tests will be evaluated (see Supplementary Information 2 and 3 (Additional file 1)).\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of rapamycin has not been thoroughly studied in the setting of an intermittent dosing scheme. As a secondary objective, we will assess the differences in whole blood concentration of the study drug among individuals by comparing peak (Cmax), trough (Ctrough), and area-under-the-curve (AUC) concentrations. This will also allow us to assess if any potential differences in the treatment effect are associated with drug whole blood concentration among participants.\nAn exploratory objective of this study is to quantify changes in multiple age-related tissue pathologies before and after rapamycin treatment, using various imaging techniques (see Table 3). If beneficial effects on multiple such pathologies can be shown, it will lend support to the hypothesis that the study drug has a general geroprotective effect in humans.\nExploratory outcomes will include assessments of changes between baseline and end-of-study imaging outcomes, such as retinal nerve fibre layer thickness, periodontal oedema, arterial stiffness and [18F]FDG uptake in arterial plaques, cardiac diastolic function, myocardial strain, cardiac microvascular function, and bone mineral density.\nAdverse events\nSafety and tolerability will be assessed through monitoring and recording of all adverse events and serious adverse events. Clinically significant deviations in vital signs, laboratory evaluations, and physical examinations will be considered as adverse events and will be followed up. To the extent possible, all adverse events will be described by their severity grade, duration, and relationship to the study drug.\nStatistics\nBased on the relatively low variability in long-term test–retest data of [18F]FDG in humans [55, 56], a sample size of N = 15 is estimated to be sufficient to detect a 5% change in cerebral grey matter metabolic rate at 80% power with a significance level of 0.05. Such a hypothesized effect size is considered feasible given previous trials of AD using [18F]FDG as an outcome measure [57, 58].\nThe change in estimated metabolic rate of grey matter [18F]FDG between baseline and follow-up imaging will be assessed using a paired t-test. Additionally, grey matter differences in standardized uptake value ratios, using the cerebellum as a pseudo-reference region (denominator), will be evaluated as a complementary outcome measure of [18F]FDG uptake. The level of significance will be set at 0.05.\nPaired t-tests will also be used to assess differences between baseline and end-of-study secondary outcome measures. We will also explore if pharmacokinetic parameters are correlated with 1) each other, 2) side effect burden, 3) treatment effect using linear models.\nEthical and regulatory considerations\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP E6). The study protocol and relevant documents were approved by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (Läkemedelsverket, number: 5.1–2023-8283), and the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Etikprövningsmyndigheten, number: 2023–03075-02 and 2023–00611-01), EudraCT number: 2023–000127-36. The trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06022068, first release August 30, 2023). Prior to study enrolment, informed consent will be obtained from each participant and their study partner.\nDiscussion\nThe ERAP trial is a phase IIa, one-arm, open-label, single-centre study designed to investigate the potential of the drug rapamycin to be repurposed as a treatment for early-stage AD. Repurposing an approved drug for a new indication has the potential to substantially reduce the cost and time of drug development [59]. In the field of AD treatment research, 37% of candidate agents in the pipeline are repurposed drugs [60].\nPossible mechanisms of action\nPreclinical data suggest that rapamycin may be an effective drug for treating neurodegenerative disorders [6, 7]. Several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been hypothesized to underlie this putative effect:\nAutophagy Regulation: Inhibition of mTOR is known to upregulate cellular macro-autophagy [9]. Deteriorating autophagy and increased mTOR activity have been observed in normal aging and in the progression of AD [61, 62]. Autophagy plays a central role in clearing intracellular toxic aggregate-prone proteins. Stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin could facilitate intercellular clearance of misfolded proteins central to the pathophysiology of AD.\nVasculoprotection: Reduced cerebral perfusion and compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) have been suggested as drivers behind AD pathology [63, 64], supported by observations of cerebrovascular dysfunction as one of the earliest detectable changes in AD patients [65]. Rapamycin has been shown to improve cerebral perfusion and BBB integrity in rodent models of AD, supporting the notion of the mTOR pathway as a potential target for brain vasculoprotection in AD [66].\nImmunomodulation: A sustained activation of microglia and ensuing inflammation is a central feature of neurodegenerative disorders, including in AD [67]. Rapamycin's effect on immune function is complex; while its main clinical use has been as an immunosuppressant, it has also been shown to augment immunity to certain pathogens [68], and improve response to influenza vaccination in elderly individuals [69]. Beneficial immunomodulatory effects could be driven by an increase in T-regulatory (Treg) cell function. Tregs might play an important role in the treatment of AD by suppressing microglia-mediated inflammation [70]. In line with this, a reduction in inflammatory CNS markers has been shown following rapamycin treatment [71], suggesting that this could be a potential mechanism for a treatment effect on AD.\nAssessment of general geroprotective properties\nIn addition to its potential as a treatment for AD, rapamycin has also been hypothesized to have a general geroprotective effect by slowing multiple age-related processes in the human body. In the ERAP trial, we aim to collect data on a wide range of age-related pathological processes using imaging techniques such as PET, MRI, CT, and retinal OCT. If positive changes are observed in multiple outcomes reflecting various age-related pathologies in different organs and tissues, it would support the hypothesis that rapamycin has a general geroprotective effect. The logistics of collecting and quantifying the listed exploratory imaging outcomes in Table 3 are facilitated by the fact that participants are already undergoing whole-body PET/CT examinations and MRI procedures for the trial's primary and secondary endpoints. Adding sequences to quantify potential changes in additional pathologies can therefore be done with acceptable levels of additional discomfort and/or radiation exposure to participants.\nLimitations\nThe main limitations of this study are the absence of a control group, small sample size, and short trial duration. Without a control group, detecting any potential inhibition of AD progression is not possible, and the current design relies on an increase in cerebral glucose metabolism in a relatively short time to demonstrate a positive treatment effect. However, ERAP is a phase IIa trial aimed at generating exploratory data on the effect of rapamycin on AD and assessing the feasibility of conducting a larger, longer and controlled clinical trial using imaging outcomes as endpoints in the future.\nConclusions\nThe study will measure a set of AD biomarkers before and after a 6-month dosing scheme, with the primary endpoint being change in [18F]FDG PET uptake in the cerebral grey matter, a well-established diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD disease progression. The findings from this repurposing effort of rapamycin can provide evidence of a novel treatment alternative for Alzheimer’s disease and form the basis for larger controlled phase IIb or III trials. This study will also investigate the potential general geroprotective effects of rapamycin on various age-related pathologies in the human body.\nSupplementary Information\nAdditional file 1: Supplementary information 1.

Starting as a promising antifungal agent, then as a potent immunosuppressant, strong anticancer drug, and now rapamycin is attracting serious attention as a rejuvenative agent and a possible contributor in treating this era pandemic, COVID-19. Due to its diverse biological activities and promising medical applications, we aimed in this review to put rapamycin under the spot and highlight its discovery, famous microbial producers, reported biological activities, chemical structure, famous analogues, and biosynthesis. Moreover, discuss some rapamycin production approaches including solid-state fermentation, and stressing out producing strain. On the other hand, describe its action mechanism and trials to use it in treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we highlighted some of the side effects accompanying its use, and describe some approaches reported to minimize these undesired effects. Finally, we report the current status of rapamycin and its analogues in global market, and discuss future prospects of this potent drug.\nKeywords: Rapamycin, Biosynthesis, Gene cluster\nIntroduction\nImmunosuppressants are important chemical compounds that keep immune system under control, especially after organ transplantation to prevent rejection of organ. Also, immunosuppressants are used to treat autoimmunity-related diseases (Fireman et al. 2004). Currently, some immunosuppressants are repurposed to contribute in treatment of COVID-19 and similar diseases that develop cytokine storm (Patocka et al. 2021). Out of the known immunosuppressants, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) is ranked among the most potent immunosuppressants. Rapamycin exerts also many bioactivities as shown in Fig. 1, such as antitumor, anticancer, antiviral, antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, lifespan extension, antiaging, neuroregenerative, and neuroprotective activities (Nührenberg et al. 2005; Cantaluppi et al. 2006; Cloughesy et al. 2008; Song et al. 2015; Yoo et al. 2017; Mohamed et al. 2019a; Maiese 2020; Martel et al. 2021). Additionally, it contributes in treating acute myeloid leukemia, retinal and choroidal vascular diseases (Yang et al. 2007; Ekici et al. 2007). Moreover, rapamycin had many approvals by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in treatment of many diseases. So rapamycin was first discovered as antifungal agents, then known for its potent diverse bioactivities including its immunosuppressing effect, anticancer and antitumor potentials. Currently, there is a spreading trend for repurposing rapamycin in treatment of this era disease, COVID-19. Hence, we aimed in this review to highlight the history, chemical structure, different analogues, biosynthesis, production, and action mechanism of rapamycin.\nFig. 1.\n\nSome uses of rapamycin and its analogues\nHistory of rapamycin discovery, biological activities, and FDA approvals\nRapamycin is a macrolide that was first discovered in 1972 as a product of the actinomycetes strain Streptomyces hygroscopicus in the Easter Island (natively known as Rapa Nui island) in Chile (Vézina et al. 1975). It was first known as antifungal agent against Candida spp. that showed activity stronger than antifungal activity achieved by amphotericin B in murine model of systemic candidiasis (Baker et al. 1978). Following studies revealed that rapamycin exhibits antitumor effect against mammary, B16 43 melanocarcinoma, colon 26, and EM ependymoblastoma cell lines (Douros and Suffness 1981; Garber 2001). Later, it was observed that this potent polyketide has strong immunosuppressive effect through inhibiting cell proliferation of antigen-induced T cell and B and antibody formation, which made rapamycin used in patients after organ transplantation, then it was licensed in 1999 by FDA as a prophylaxis agent for renal rejection (Seto 2012). Although the discovery of rapamycin was in 1975, the year 1995 is considered as the golden year for this potent polyketide as lots of studies were published focusing on rapamycin production, biosynthesis, and elucidation of its action mechanism (Kojima et al. 1995; Cheng; Fang and Demain, 1995; Nlshida et al. 1995; Dumont and Su 1995). However, rapamycin continues to attract attention and keep updating its uses, as it was repurposed after the spread of the pandemic COVID-19. Also, it got a new FDA approval in 2021 to be used for treatment of some tumors. Actually, apart from FDA approvals recorded for its analogues, rapamycin itself has four FDA approvals in its record, the first was in 1999 for preventing kidney rejection after transplantation, and the second was in 2003 to be used as antirestenosis agent that prevents restenosis of coronary arteries after angioplasty procedures due to its strong inhibiting effect on the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (Tsang et al. 2007; Hambright et al. 2020). Later, rapamycin got also FDA approval for promoting life span in different organisms and delaying many age-related diseases (Arriola Apelo et al. 2016a). The fourth FDA approval was in 2021 for treatment of locally advanced metastatic or unresectable malignant perivascular epithelioid tumors (Świtaj et al. 2021).\nChemical structure of rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogues)\nThe structure of rapamycin was detected using X-ray crystallography together with 1H and 13C NMR analysis (Paiva et al. 1991). Rapamycin molecule consists of a very large lactone ring (macrolide ring) that contains α-ketonic group. This ring is formed through condensation of propionate and acetate together with the polyketide ring (Fig. 2). The ring backbone carries 3 conjugated double bonds. A sole nitrogen atom exists in this polyketide. Moreover, rapamycin structure carries 6 membered hemiketal ring (C10 to C14). Out of lactone ring, a tri-substituted cyclohexane ring (C37 to C42) is found (Paiva et al. 1991). Many analogues were derivatized from rapamycin (Fig. 2). Everolimus is the 2-hydroxyethyl derivative of rapamycin that is used mainly as an immunosuppressant that targets causes of chronic allograft dysfunction or late graft loss (Nashan 2002). It is the first oral inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and its mode of action resemble that of rapamycin, as it blocks interleukin (IL)-2- and IL-15-driven proliferation of B cells, T cells, vascular smooth muscle cell through inhibition of p70 S6 kinase activation, which results in arresting the cell cycle at G1 phase, and preventing cells progression to S phase (Nashan 2002; Chapman and Perry 2004). This inhibitory action is mediated via formation of a complex together with immunophilin FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) in a potency threefold higher than rapamycin does (Schuler et al. 1997; Chapman and Perry 2004). It got FDA approval in 2009 for treating advanced kidney cancer (Atkins et al. 2009).\n\nChemical structure of rapamycin and some of its analouges\nZotarolimus (known also as ABT-578) is another derivative of rapamycin (Fig. 2). It is semi-synthetically developed to also prevent restenosis (Burke et al. 2006; Vedantham et al. 2010). Zotarolimus has a shorter in vivo half-life with potency that is comparable to that of rapamycin (Chen et al. 2007). Zotarolimus differs from everolimus by having tetrazole group adjacent to the methoxy group instead of hydroxyethyl substituent existing in everolimus. Ridaforolimus (previously known as deforolimus) is a nonprodrug analogue of rapamycin, where a phosphate group substituted the secondary alcohol moiety at C43 (Dancey and Monzon 2011). Ridaforolimus was designed to improve solubility and oral delivery (Mita et al. 2008), and treat bone sarcoma or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (De Vera and Reznik 2019). Ridaforolimus inhibits cell growth, metabolism, division, and angiogenesis. It has antitumor activity against different in vitro and in vivo models (Rivera et al. 2011). Temsirolimus (also known as Rapamune) is a soluble ester derivative of rapamycin. In 2007, temsirolimus became the first mTOR-targeting agent that obtained FDA approval for treating patients having advanced renal cell carcinoma (Le Tourneau et al. 2008). Unlike everolimus and zotarolimus, temsirolimus is given intravenously due to its poor absorption when orally administered (Boni et al. 2009), and majority of temsirolimus is excreted in feces and around 5% is excreted in urine (Omae et al. 2016).\nBiosynthesis of rapamycin\nRapamycin biosynthesis was described in many studies (Reynolds and Demain 1997; Mohamed et al. 2019a). Concerning precursors involved in rapamycin biosynthesis, the macrolide ring characterizing rapamycin is synthesized from seven propionate units together with seven acetate units, while methionine is the precursor from which the three O-methyl groups are derived (Paiva et al. 1991). On the other hand, the heterocyclic ring existing in rapamycin structure originates from pipecolic acid that is synthesized from lysine, while cyclohexane moiety is derived from the shikimic acid pathway (Paiva et al. 1993a; b). Rapamycin biosynthetic mechanism begins with the cyclohexane ring to which acetate and propionate molecules are added to construct a polyketide backbone in a head-to-tail way. Later, the pipecolate is linked to the polyketide chain, and the ring is closed by lactone formation. The 3 methyl groups are then transferred from methionine by S-adenosyl methionine to make the three methoxy groups (Mohamed et al. 2019a).\nThe gene cluster involved in rapamycin biosynthesis in strain Streptomyces rapamycinicus NRRL 5491 was reported and deposited in GeneBank under the accession number X86780 (Schwecke et al. 1995). The rapamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC29253, and Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 are shown in Fig. 3, and reported or putative function of rapamycin production genes in Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC29253 are shown in Table (1). The difference between the rapamycin biosynthetic gene clusters in these two rapamycin producers (Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC29253 and Actinoplanes sp. N902-109) was studied by Huang et al. (2015). In that study, sequence and organization of the genes were compared using different softwares including Glimmer 3.02, anti-SMASH, and Subsystem Technology. Organization of some genes (the multifunctional polyketide synthases (PKS) genes RapA, RapB, RapC, and NRPS-like RapP). Differences appeared in organization of precursor synthesis genes and macrolactone modification flanked the PKS core region in N902-109, while their homologs in ATCC29253 were located downstream of the PKS core region. Moreover, ATCC29253 gene cluster lacked homolog of gene encoding a putative type II thioesterase responsible for over-production of rapamycin in N902-109. Additionally, ATCC29253 gene cluster lacked also homologs of gene rapQ encoding a methyltransferase in N902-109, and rapM gene was discovered instead of it in ATCC29253. As shown in Table 1, PKS genes are rap A, B, and C, while nonribosomal peptide synthetase NRPS-like gene is rapP. The precursor synthesis genes responsible for precursor synthesis, macrolactone regulation, and tailoring (rapO, rapN, rapM, rapL, rapK, rapJ, rapI, rapH, and rapG) are located downstream of the PKS genes (Huang et al. 2015). Studying and understanding rapamycin biosynthetic gene cluster can help in constructing many rapamycin bioactive analogs and increase its productivity through conducting genetic manipulation and precursor-directed biosynthesis (Graziani et al. 2003; Gregory et al. 2004; Mohamed et al. 2019a).\n\nBiosynthetic gene clusters of rapamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC29253 (a), and Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 (b)\nRapamycin biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC29253\nRapamycin production\nOut of all reported producers of rapamycin, the actinomycetes genus Streptomyces is the most famous and predominant producer of this potent polyketide. Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC 29253 (NRRL 5491; AY B-994; DSM 41530; IMET 43975) was the first reported producer of rapamycin (Vezina et al. 1975). Later, two other strains of S. hygroscopicus (strain AY B 1206 and strain C9) were identified as rapamycin producers (Kojima et al. 1995). At the same year, rapamycin was also produced by the strain S. hygroscopicus FC904 (Nlshida et al. 1995). Actinoplanes sp. N902-109 was also introduced as a producer of rapamycin that brock the rapamycin exclusiveness reported for S. hygroscopicus (Nlshida et al. 1995). Production of rapamycin is commonly performed using shaken flasks inoculated with Streptomyces hygroscopicus in specific production medium containing mannose and/or fructose as carbon sources (Kojima et al. 1995; Mohamed et al. 2019b). Moreover, addition of amino acid such as L-lysine positively increases production yield (Cheng et al. 1995). On the contrary, amino acids as phenylalanine and methionine had negative influence on rapamycin production (Mohamed et al. 2019b). Few studies have described production of rapamycin in complex media such as medium containing shikimic acid which failed to increase titer of rapamycin (Fang and Demain 1995). Different approach was conducted by Mohamed et al. (2019b), who studied the effect of stressing-out Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC 29253 on rapamycin production. Using medium supplemented with 1% NaCl caused 56.4% increase in obtained rapamycin yield. Moreover, the yield reached 129.7% by using 1.5-fold concentrated production medium, and higher yield (132%) was achieved when incubation was under fluctuated temperatures. Many other stressing-out factors didn’t affect rapamycin production such as repeated inoculation of producer strain, adding camel milk to medium components, using nano-sized soymeal, and coculturing with sensitive strain such as Candida albicans (Mohamed et al. 2019b). Solid-state fermentation (SSF) is fermentation technique that is used in pharmaceuticals, food, textile and other industrial fields. SSF is used instead of liquid medium and is characterized by being simpler, cost-saving, results in higher productivity, shorter time of production, lower energy, and requiring reduced volumetric size (Manan and Webb 2018). On the other hand, SSF requires studying behavior of several parameters related to transfer of mass, gases, and heat through the small solid medium particles (Krishna 2005; Singhania et al. 2009).\nMany biologically active compounds in general, and macrolides in particular have been produced using SSF including erythromycin, carbomycin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, oleandomycin, spiramycin, pimaricin, and tylosin. However, studies describing production of rapamycin using SSF are quite rare. Khedkar et al. (2004) used S. tsukubaensis for rapamycin production using SSF medium. In this patent, the medium consisted of wheat rava, wheat bran, oat meal, broken wheat, boiled rice, rice rava, beaten rice, maize bran, maize grits, oat bran, bagasse, tapioca residue, soy grits, soy flakes, rice flakes, ceramic beads, glass beads, sponge or mixture of any of them. Khedkar et al. used carbon source from glucose, different source starches, sucrose, maltose, malto-dextrin, soybean oil, acetate or mixture of any of the above-mentioned carbon sources. On the other hand, they used nitrogen source from ammonium sulphate, dried yeast, yeast extract, casein hydrolyzate, soy peptone, bacteriological peptone, cotton seed flour, corn steep liquor or mixture of any of the above-mentioned nitrogen sources. Chiang (2015) has studied the effect of adding 4 g/L carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) on rapamycin production, which resulted in obtaining 323 mg/L of rapamycin compared to 165 mg/L in the control without CMC. Also, Chiang conducted SSF using 8 substrates in order to explore their effect on rapamycin production. As result, barley caused remarkable increase in rapamycin production (393 mg/kg), while maximum rapamycin yield (525 mg/L) was achieved by using solid barley. On the other hand, Chiang has also studied the static adsorption of rapamycin using macroporous adsorption resin, MAC-3 (0.5 g of resin), which increased rapamycin production to 700 mg/L.\nRapamycin action mechanism\nThe molecular receptor (target) of rapamycin is known as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a P13K-related protein kinase that play an important main role in regulation of different cell activities such as protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, cell survival and proliferation (Savvoulidis et al. 2019). This regulatory effect is based on inhibiting multiple downstream actions of mTOR’s activity including synthesizing components (as ribosomes) needed for synthesis of macromolecular, increasing cell size, and progression of cell cycle through the G1 phase (Savvoulidis et al. 2019). Generally, mTOR has two functionally distinct complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) as illustrated in Fig. 4. The first one (mTORC1) integrates different signals from growth factors, energy levels, nutrients, and oxygen such as amino acids to promote cell growth and proliferation by activation of various anabolic processes such as lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis. Moreover, stimulates energy metabolism processes such as glutamine metabolism and glycolysis. Also, inhibits some catabolic processes as autophagy. On the other hand, the second complex (mTORC2) only responds to growth factors and regulates both cell survival and actin/cytoskeleton organization. It\n\nThe two functional mTOR complexes and their role in regulating main cellular processes\n should be noted that rapamycin acutely inhibits mTORC1, while chronic exposure to rapamycin can results also in inhibiting mTORC2 (Fig. 4). The action mechanism of rapamycin allows it to interrupt cytokine signaling which stimulates growth and differentiation of lymphocytes. This process begins when rapamycin binds to, and forms a complex with a cytosolic specific protein known as FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12). The resulting complex interacts with mTOR and blocks progression of the cell cycle of T cells that causes suppression of T-cell proliferation that is induced by cross-linking of antigenic peptides, T-cell receptors, or cytokines as interleukins (Dumont and Su 1995; Park et al. 2010). Dumont and Su (1995) have described two main biochemical changes that take place during this mode of action. As a start, rapamycin binds to FKP12, and form a complex that physically interacts with mTOR which is acting upstream of two enzymes. The first one is enzyme p70 S6 kinase (p70s6k) which is inhibited causing an early response of cytokine-induced mitogenesis. After inhibiting p70s6k (its main substrate is 40S ribosomal subunit S6 protein), rapamycin starts to decrease translation of some mRNA encoding for elongation factors and ribosomal proteins and consequently decreases protein synthesis. On the other hand, the second enzyme is cyclin-dependent kinase cdk2-cyclin E complex, which is responsible for regulating Gl/S transition. This enzyme inactivation is caused by preventing decline of its inhibitor (p27 cdk) which normally follows stimulation of IL-2.\nRepurposing rapamycin for COVID-19\nThe spread of COVID-19 pandemic caused by human coronavirus-2, and its related high mortalities have left the world helpless without any effective cure. As there is no time to waste on screening for novel compounds as a sole solution of this disease, current trends are focusing on repurposing and testing available drugs (known for treating other diseases) and check their activity against corona virus. The idea of testing the anti-COVID-19 activity of rapamycin came from its ability to inhibit synthesis of protein, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (as IL-2, IL-6 and, IL-10). Hence rapamycin can, from theoretical point of view, inhibit viral synthesis, prevent cytokine storms. Therefore, rapamycin was evaluated for its anti COVID-19 activity (Husain and Byrareddy 2020), and some studies have described its potency as promising candidate for treating COVID-19 when compared with available antiviral medications because its efficiency may not be affected by high mutation rate of viral RNA, which made antiviral drugs helpless.\nSome studies have reported the use of rapamycin and other mTOR for calming down cytokine storms and preventing progression of COVID-19 (Omarjee et al. 2020; Patocka et al. 2021). Other studies have described the effect of combining the action of rapamycin together with different drugs such as metformin, lithium chloride, or calcineurin inhibitors (Khalil 2020; Hasbal et al. 2021; Karp 2021). The rejuvenative potentials of rapamycin and rapalogues (Guarda et al. 2004; Blagosklonny, 2007; Lamming et al. 2013; Dai et al. 2014; Ghasemnejad-Berenji 2021) were also suggested to be another reason to use them in reducing severity and impacts of infection with COVID-19 (Husain and Byrareddy 2020; Guarda et al. 2014; Blagosklonny 2020; Bischof et al. 2021). However, further studies are critically needed to evaluate and consider consequences of using mTOR drugs as rapamycin against COVID-19.\nSome adverse reactions accompanying treatment with rapamycin and rapalogues\nAlthough rapamycin and rapalogues are used in treatment of different diseases and in decreasing chances of organ rejection after organ transplant, many side effects were reported accompanying their use. Generally, adverse reactions represent a major concern that sometimes can limit application of any drug. Side effects reported for using rapamycin in patients having organ transplant to avoid organ rejection includes thrombocytopenia, immunosuppression, impaired wound healing, stomatitis, glucose intolerance, high serum and cholesterol triglycerides (Kaeberlein 2013; Johnson and Kaeberlein 2016; Arriola Apelo et al. 2016b). Being an immunosuppressant is commonly accompanied with an elevated risk of infection or even cancer due to the ability of rapamycin and rapalogues to suppress some tumor immune mechanism (Dumas and Lamming 2020). It should be noted that chances of occurrence of such side effects increases when rapalogues are given at a high dose and chronically. However, applying some techniques during treatment with rapamycin can minimize side effects. Such techniques focus on using local rapamycin treatment instead of its systemic administration, or applying an intermittent rapamycin dosing schedule, or using rapalogues instead of rapamycin itself. Falke et al. (2015) have reported that administrating microspheres loaded with rapamycin under the kidney capsule of ureter-obstructed rats inhibited local fibrotic response and decreased systemic adverse effects of rapamycin.\nOn the other hand, Arriola Apelo et al. (2016a) have mentioned that some rapamycin side effects are mediated by the inhibition of a second mTOR-containing complex that is less sensitive to rapamycin (other than the known complex formed when rapamycin interact with FKP12). Hence, it was suggested that compounds targeting the first complex in a more specific way may reduce majority of mediated side effects. Arriola Apelo et al. have also identified an intermittent rapamycin dosing schedule with a reduced adverse effects when compared to daily treatment with rapamycin especially on immune system, glucose and pyruvate tolerance, insulin levels, and fasting glucose. Similarly, many studies have described the safe toxicity profile of rapalogues with reduced side effects on glucose and pyruvate tolerance (Pallet and Legendre 2013; Arriola Apelo et al. 2016a; Su et al. 2016). However, some side effects indeed reported after treatment with rapalogues such as mucositis, skin rashes, anemia, fatigue, neutropenia, and metabolic disorders such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia, pulmonary toxicity, secondary lymphoma (De Masson et al. 2011; Paplomata et al. 2013; Cheaib et al. 2015; Guimarães et al. 2015; Viana et al. 2018; Arena et al. 2021; Dang et al. 2021).\nRapamycin in drug market\nThe insufficient availability of rapamycin is the main reason for its high price. The global market of rapamycin was USD 275.93 Million in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 302.77 Million by the year 2028. The price of oral tablets of sirolimus (concentration of 0.5 mg) is about $226/30 tablets, which is expensive when compared with other generic drugs. Rapamycin is produced commercially under many trade names such as Rapamune®™ is released in markets in 1999 and come in two different formulations: oral solution, and coated tablets. Sirolimus® 1 mg, Rapamune 0.5 mg, Rapamune 1 mg and Rapamycine®. Other derivatives of rapamycin such as everolimus; temsirolimus; and zotarolimus under the trade names Certican®, Afinitor®, Xience V®, Endeavor®, and Torisel® are also available (Fig. 5).\n\nSome rapamycin products. Sirolimus tablets 1 mg https://www.indiamart.com/ (a), Rapamune 0.5 mg https://www.indiamart.com/ (b), Sirolimus 1 mg https://www.wiitus.com/ (c), Rapamycine https://www.longlonglife.org/ (d), and Afinitor (5 mg) (e)\nConclusion and future prospects\nAlthough it is discovered in the seventies of the previous century, rapamycin is still considered as miraculous drug that started as antifungal agent, then its diverse biological activities and therapeutic potentials were explored. Understanding potency of this drug has nominated it for repurposing as a potential treatment or support to other COVID-19 treatment. Extensive investigations are required to evaluate impact of such approach. Constructing a database website that carry all updated studies and trials conducted in this field is extremely important, as it will decrease chances of repeating approaches that were tried by other scientific groups, and reduce the time consumed by researchers moving between different search engines and scientific websites to check for scientific data available for a certain topic.\nOn the other hand, further studies are needed to increase productivity of this important drug. Solid-state fermentation, although still not commonly applied, represents promising approach for increasing production of rapamycin. Similarly, stressing out producer strain, genetic manipulation can have important roles in achieving such a purpose.\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nAll authors have contributed in writing the manuscript.

These effects include a decline in diastolic function, left ventricular hypertrophy, metabolic substrate shifts, and alterations in the cardiac proteome. Previous work from our laboratory indicated that short‐term (10‐week) treatment with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, improved measures of these age‐related changes. In this report, we demonstrate that the rapamycin‐dependent improvement of diastolic function is highly persistent, while decreases in both cardiac hypertrophy and passive stiffness are substantially persistent 8 weeks after cessation of an 8‐week treatment of rapamycin in both male and female 22‐ to 24‐month‐old C57BL/6NIA mice. The proteomic and metabolomic abundance changes that occur after 8 weeks of rapamycin treatment have varying persistence after 8 further weeks without the drug. However, rapamycin did lead to a persistent increase in abundance of electron transport chain (ETC) complex components, most of which belonged to Complex I. Although ETC protein abundance and Complex I activity were each differentially affected in males and females, the ratio of Complex I activity to Complex I protein abundance was equally and persistently reduced after rapamycin treatment in both sexes. Thus, rapamycin treatment in the aged mice persistently improved diastolic function and myocardial stiffness, persistently altered the cardiac proteome in the absence of persistent metabolic changes, and led to persistent alterations in mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. These observations suggest that an optimal translational regimen for rapamycin therapy that promotes enhancement of healthspan may involve intermittent short‐term treatments.\nKeywords: aging, echocardiography, heart, persistence, proteomics, rapamycin\nCardiac morbidity and mortality increase with age in both mice and humans. Here, we demonstrate that 8‐week treatment with rapamycin is sufficient to persistently improve diastolic function, decrease age‐related cardiac hypertrophy and passive stiffness, and modulate the cardiac proteome, even a further 8 weeks after cessation of treatment. These observations suggest that an optimal translational regimen for rapamycin therapy that promotes enhancement of healthspan may involve intermittent short‐term treatments.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIt is estimated that by 2030, over 8 million people will suffer from heart failure (HF) in the United States alone (Heidenreich et al., 2013). In the developed world, HF is the condition most responsible for poor healthspan in males (age‐standardized years lived with disability; Moran et al., 2014). The estimated cost of HF in the United States is estimated to be $70 billion by 2030 (Heidenreich et al., 2013). Historically, most attention has been focused on HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), such as may result after myocardial infarction; however, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study reported that 47% of US hospitalizations due to HF were due to HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; Chang et al., 2014). HFpEF is generally defined clinically by signs and/or symptoms of HF combined with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). In this setting, reduced cardiac output is related to impaired diastolic LV filling, and this results in exercise intolerance and contributes to frailty. Cardiac aging in both humans and mice is characterized by a progressive decrease in diastolic function and an increase in LV hypertrophy (Chiao & Rabinovitch, 2015). These similarities make aging rodents a good model for study of pharmacotherapies directed toward correcting diastolic function (Dai & Rabinovitch, 2009). While in recent decades medical management has enjoyed substantial success in improving health and survival of patients with HFrEF, effective treatment for HFpEF has been elusive. Despite the efforts of several large randomized clinical trials designed to improve quality of life in patients with HFpEF, results have thus far been largely disappointing (Plitt, Spring, Moulton, & Agrawal, 2018).\nRapamycin is an FDA‐approved drug that directly inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) Complex I (C1). Inhibition of mTORC1 has wide‐ranging effects in vivo, including altering protein synthesis, inhibiting cell growth, and stimulating stress response mechanisms and autophagy. Transient or lifelong treatment extends lifespan and/or healthspan in many organisms, ranging from nematodes to primates (Bitto, Wang, Bennett, & Kaeberlein, 2015). Rapamycin extends murine lifespan in both sexes, even when administered at 9 or 20 months of age in genetically heterogeneous mice (Harrison et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2011), and in C57BL/6 mice at 19 (Zhang et al., 2014) or 20–21 months of age (Bitto et al., 2016). The lifespan and healthspan extension due to rapamycin is both dose‐ and sex‐dependent (Miller et al., 2014). Clinically, rapamycin and so‐called “rapalogs” are used to prevent rejection after organ transplantation (Fine & Kushwaha, 2016) and for the prevention of restenosis after insertion of cardiac stents (Park et al., 2013). Major concerns in considering potential clinical translation of rapamycin treatment are potential detrimental effects that include immunomodulation, gonadal atrophy, and stomatitis (Boers‐Doets et al., 2013; Pallet & Legendre, 2013). However, these adverse effects are generally reversible, leading to the question of whether the more desirable healthspan effects of rapamycin might persist after the undesirable effects have resolved.\nWork from our laboratory and others has shown that continuous rapamycin improves cardiac function, most specifically diastolic function, when administered to middle‐ or late‐aged mice (Dai et al., 2014; Flynn et al., 2013). Rapamycin can also improve cardiac structure and function in the context of various genetic and experimental conditions that promote cardiac disease (Das et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2014).\nIn this study, we analyzed functional and molecular outcomes from continuous and transient rapamycin treatment in aged, male and female C57BL/6 mice. In both sexes, rapamycin treatment replicated our previous results showing a significant improvement in cardiac diastolic function, and this effect was persistent for 2 months after rapamycin was eliminated from the diet. By focusing on molecular changes due to rapamycin treatment that persist after drug removal, we hoped to shed light on the specific mechanisms of cardiac functional rejuvenation induced by rapamycin treatment.\n2. RESULTS\n2.1. Rapamycin persistently improves diastolic function\nIn both humans and mice, diastolic function is measured by comparing the relative proportion of LV filling that takes place in early diastole by LV relaxation (Ea) versus that takes place in late diastole, secondary to atrial contraction (Aa). In healthy hearts, the early component is greater than the late component, and diastolic dysfunction is conventionally ascribed when there is a reversal of this ratio, that is, an early‐to‐late filling ratio below 1.0. At the start of the study, the 24‐month‐old male and 22‐month‐old female mice (both at 75th percentile of lifespan; Turturro et al., 1999) demonstrated an Ea/Aa ratio averaging close to 1 (approximately half the mice above and half below 1.0), which is typical of this age in C57BL/6NIA mice. In the control group, this ratio stayed steady, but animals exposed to rapamycin for 8 weeks improved their diastolic function significantly (Figure 1a). As noted previously, this level of improvement brought the Ea/Aa ratio back approximately halfway to that of young mice (Chiao et al., 2016; Dai et al., 2014). After cessation of treatment, rapamycin‐induced improvement persisted for an additional 8 weeks, with cardiac performance maintained at levels near those of mice receiving 16‐week continuous rapamycin treatment (diastolic function, 82% persistent in females and 78% in males at 16 weeks).\n\nRapamycin persistently improves diastolic function and reverses cardiac hypertrophy. (a) Ea/Aa ratios of female and male mice over the course of treatment (average ± SEM). Continuous rapamycin treatment (rapa, dotted line), persistence (pers, dashed line), and aged control (control, solid line). Both rapa and persistence groups are statistically significantly higher than controls for weeks 8, 12, and 16 by one‐way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc for all groups at each time point per sex. Rapa and persistence groups’ Ea/Aa increased significantly by one‐way ANOVA with repeated measures for each group over time. (b) Systolic function parameters measured by echocardiography at 16 weeks.

(c) Heart mass in grams normalized to tibia length (mm) for all groups at 16 weeks. p‐values from Tukey's post hoc tests when sex‐specific one‐way ANOVA was significant. * versus young, # versus control, and versus rapa. (d) Body mass in grams for all groups over time. *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001\nOur previous work in 24‐ to 26‐month‐old female C57BL/6NIA mice showed no significant change in systolic functional measures (fractional shortening, FS and EF) during 10 weeks of rapamycin treatment (Dai et al., 2014). Concordantly, there were no measurable differences in FS or EF in the female mice at 16 weeks in this study (Figure 1b). However, males showed a small, but statistically significant, reduced FS and EF in old compared to young control mice. While rapamycin‐treated old mouse EF and FS were intermediate between young and old values for both sexes, these differences did not reach significance.\nWe quantitated cardiac hypertrophy by measuring cardiac weight normalized to tibia length at necropsy (Figure 1c). Female mice at 16 weeks showed a decrease in cardiac hypertrophy after rapamycin treatment, and this effect trended toward persistent (p = .086) by t test. Males also showed a reduction in hypertrophy with rapamycin treatment (p = .012), and again, this difference approached significance in the persistence group (p = .081) by t test. Combining both sexes by scaling all data to the same‐sex control average did yield a significant difference between old and persistence groups (Figure S1). The reduction in cardiac hypertrophy cannot be explained by reduction in overall body size, as the body weight over time in all groups was similar and relatively stable (Figure 1d). Young animals were smaller for both sexes (mean ± SEM F: 21.01 ± 0.60, M: 29.57 ± 0.39).\n2.2. Passive stiffness of the left ventricle is decreased with rapamycin\nTo examine whether the change in diastolic function could be due to passive rather than active relaxation of the left ventricle, we extracted LV multicellular preparations from our control, rapamycin, persistence, and young animals (n = 5~8 per group) and tested how much force it took to passively stretch the demembranated myocardium (Figure 2a). This stiffness generally increases with age in mice, dogs, and humans (Asif et al., 2000; Campbell & Sorrell, 2015). We found that rapamycin treatment significantly and persistently reversed the age‐related increase in passive stiffness of the preparations. We did not detect a significant difference in the passive stiffness of rapamycin‐treated groups compared to persistence groups. These data suggest that myocardial passive stiffness is a significant contributor to the diastolic dysfunction seen with aging and that rapamycin can persistently reverse this effect. One potential cause of increased passive stiffness is increased fibrosis of the extracellular matrix of the ventricular wall (Jalil et al., 1989). We examined this by staining with picrosirius red and quantifying percent of collagen deposition detected under polarizing light. We observed no significant differences between old groups (control, rapamycin, and persistence; Figure 2b).\n\nPassive stiffness increases with age and is persistently decreased with rapamycin. (a) Passive force for each mouse in each condition is shown for six length changes. All data were normalized to the control animals at 24% length change. Mean ± SEM is shown for each group at each length change. p‐values are from linear modeling of log‐transformed data. N = 3~12 mice per group. (b) Percent positive picrosirius red staining in ventricle slices. Each dot is median % fibrosed area for one mouse. C: control; R: rapamycin; P: persistence; Y: young\n2.3. Rapamycin dramatically alters protein abundance in both sexes; however, the persistence of these changes varies by sex\nIn our previous work, we applied proteomics to detect many differences in protein abundances due to 10‐week rapamycin treatment beginning at 24 months in female C57BL/6NIA mice (Dai et al., 2014). Thus, an important question was whether the changes in proteome abundance with rapamycin treatment were persistent after drug removal. Figure 3a shows heatmaps of the set of all proteins in each sex which had a significant difference between control and continuous rapamycin treatment at the 16‐week time point (by Student's t test, adjusted for multiple comparisons, as described in Methods). (Figure S2 shows principal component analysis for males and females using the same data as Figure 3a) In the comparison between continuous treatment and persistence groups, females had close similarities between these two groups, while the males showed persistence group protein abundances that were intermediate between old control and continuous rapamycin. Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to identify significantly changed canonical pathways. This revealed that eight of the top 10 pathways were conserved between sexes. The five most significantly changed pathways in each sex are shown in the heatmap of Figure 3b, four of which are conserved between sexes; again, it is apparent that the rapamycin and persistence groups are similar in the females, but in the male cohort, the persistence group is more intermediate. Gene names and z‐scores for all heatmaps are listed in Tables S1–S4. The distribution of percent persistence of the proteins within each IPA category is plotted in Figure 3c. It can be seen that for all top six pathways but mitochondrial dysfunction, the median protein abundance in the female persistence groups is actually a larger change (120%–125% effect in the same direction) than in the continuous rapamycin treatment group, whereas the median mitochondrial dysfunction pathway persistence is ~86% persistent in females (Table S5). As predicted by the overall proteomics, persistence within IPA pathways was appreciably lower in males than females and differences between pathways were less apparent.\n\nPersistence of abundance changes in proteins in top IPA pathways differs by sex. (a) Dendrograms and heatmaps showing all significantly altered protein abundances due to rapamycin for each sex. Dendrograms show Spearman's distance as a measure of relatedness. Color shows z‐scores of protein abundance differences by protein, with red indicating greater abundance and blue meaning less abundance (−1.15 > z > 1.15). (b) Z‐score heatmaps of protein abundance, organized into the five most significantly altered pathways (by IPA) for each sex—females on the left and males on the right. (c) Asymmetrical beanplots show the range of the percent persistence for proteins in each IPA category (y‐axis), with females (light gray) on the left side of each bean and males (dark gray) on the right. Black bars denote the median of the range for each sex/category. The data range was limited to 0%–200% for easier visualization. All data shown are from tissue collected at the 16‐week time point in the old mice. C—untreated control, R—continuous rapamycin treatment, and P—persistence 8 weeks after cessation of 8‐week treatment. Protein names are shown in Tables S1~S4\n\nThe mitochondrial dysfunction pathway is a larger set of proteins (females n = 27, males n = 55) compared to the other top five pathways (females n = 6–18, males n = 19–29), and was more heterogeneous. When electron transport chain (ETC) proteins alone were examined, persistence was varied between the sexes and the individual complexes of the ETC (Table 1), with the females again generally showing greater persistence in each complex than the males. Interestingly, the mean persistence of proteins in Complex V of the respiratory chain (ATP synthase) was very high in both sexes. Many of the proteins found to be altered significantly in both sexes for the mitochondrial dysfunction category were associated with Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the ETC; persistence of proteins in this complex was 76.90% in females and 26.34% in males.\nAverage percent persistence per individual complex of the respiratory chain by sex\nThe four complexes of the ETC, along with ATP synthase, are shown along with the average percent persistence of all proteins found in each category. The standard deviation (SD) and the number of proteins in each complex (n) are also shown. The data were limited to eliminate outliers (Q1‐IQR*1.5 < protein percent persistence < Q3 + IQR*1.5).\nOne explanation for variation in the degree of persistence of proteins might be a relationship with protein half‐life, in that proteins with faster turnover might show less persistent changes after withdrawal of rapamycin treatment. However, we did not find any significant correlation between persistence of protein abundance changes due to rapamycin and our previously measured half‐lives of the same proteins in the heart (Dai et al., 2014; data not shown).\n2.4. Rapamycin differentially alters respiratory chain complex activity by sex\nSince rapamycin did persistently alter ETC Complex I (CI) peptide abundances for both sexes, we hypothesized that there may be a connection between ETC complex activity and diastolic function—that is, rapamycin might persistently alter the function of the ETC in both sexes and more specifically that rapamycin might change the ratio of complex activity to complex abundance, thereby changing the flux through the ETC. Electron flux is largely responsible for determining the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨM), by creating a proton gradient across in the inner mitochondrial membrane. An increase in ΔΨM has been correlated with an increase in the production of ROS in myocardium and in isolated cardiac mitochondria (Aon, Cortassa, & O'Rourke, 2008; Chen & Zweier, 2014). Rapamycin has previously been shown to lower ΔΨM, through a mechanism independent of its well‐known cellular targets (Schieke et al., 2006). Thus, changing the ratio of complex activity to complex abundance might reduce the ΔΨM from a more pathological level in the aging heart, to a more physiological level. The impact of this could be reduced ROS, while maintaining appropriate ATP production, as needed for cardiac cycling activity. We therefore compared activity levels of the individual ETC complexes to the abundance of Complex proteins in the ETC, thereby obtaining a measure of activity/quantity of ETC protein.\nIn the female cohorts, we were unable to detect significant differences in activity of CI, CII, and CIV between treatment groups (by ANOVA; Figure 4). There was, however, an age‐related increase in CIII activity in females, which was reduced persistently by rapamycin. Males showed a significant increase in CI activity with aging, which was partially reversed, again persistently, with rapamycin (Figure 4). Males also showed a significant increase in CII activity with rapamycin, though this was not persistent eight weeks after drug removal. All complex activity data were normalized to mitochondrial content, as determined by citrate synthase (CS) activity (see Figure S3). We also measured mitochondrial:nuclear DNA ratios in all samples and determined that mitochondrial content by this metric was similar between all old groups within each sex (Figure S3).\n\nRapamycin alters ETC Complex activity differentially by sex. (a) Boxplots of the activity in nmol/min mg−1 of each of the complexes, normalized to the activity of citrate synthase for each sample, then as a ratio against the control average activity per complex. Each data point is one mouse (average from technical triplicates). N per group is 8 to 16. C—control at 16 weeks, P—persistence, R—rapa, Y—young. Stars indicate significance, by Tukey's post hoc after an ANOVA of all groups per sex/complex which had an ANOVA p < .05, compared to control. *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001\nWhile there was sexual dimorphism in the abundance and activity of components of ETC CI and CIII, both sexes consistently demonstrated a much greater ratio of activity:abundance in old controls than in young animals (Figure 5; see Discussion). The 16‐week rapamycin and the persistence treatment groups both showed a significant decline in the ratio of activity:abundance of CI, bringing levels toward that of the young animals. Inclusion of accessory components in addition to core components of CI did not substantially alter this effect. In CIII, females, but not males, showed a reversal of the age‐dependent increase in activity:abundance ratio in rapamycin and persistence groups (Figure 5). Consistent changes were not found in CII or CIV.\n\nRapamycin reduces ETC Complex I activity:Complex I protein ratios in both male and female mice, and Complex III activity:protein ratios in females. Calculation of activity to abundance ratio of protein was: (average individual complex activity per group divided by the average individual complex activity level of old control of same sex)/(average individual complex protein fold changes of each group divided by the old control). p‐values from one‐way ANOVAs performed per sex/complex, followed by Tukey's post hoc test when ANOVA was significant (after FDR correction). Each point is one animal. *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001\n2.5. Metabolome differences seen at 8 weeks of rapamycin treatment are largely not persistent\nPrevious studies by our laboratory and others have shown evidence of an age‐related metabolic substrate switch from dependence on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to glycolysis (Chiao et al., 2016; Wende, Brahma, McGinnis, & Young, 2017). Concordant with a more youthful function, we previously found evidence of a reversal of this aging substrate shift in mice treated for 10 weeks with rapamycin (Dai et al., 2014). This was confirmed by 13C glucose labeling and nuclear magnetic resonance in Langendorff‐perfused hearts (Chiao et al., 2016). In the present study, we found that the metabolomic changes after eight weeks of rapamycin treatment largely disappear after treatment with rapamycin is continued for a further eight weeks (Table 2). Categories shown in Table 2 were related to the metabolic substrate switch previously seen at 10 weeks of treatment with rapamycin. (See Figures S4 and S5 for more detailed information on the metabolite and enzyme abundances in the TCA cycle and glycolysis, respectively.) This does not appear to be simply a survivorship effect because the control hearts continue to show poor diastolic function at this later time point. It thus appears more likely that the rapamycin effects on cardiac metabolism are transient in nature. The metabolic shift may contribute to persistent cardiac remodeling, but it appears unlikely to be one of the major causes of the persistent functional changes that we observe (Figure 5).\nMetabolome changes due to aging are not persistently reversed by rapamycin\n\nP/C: persistence/control; R/C: rapa/control; Y/C: young/control.

DISCUSSION\nAge‐related diastolic dysfunction is a pervasive problem with no current well‐targeted treatment options. Diastolic dysfunction limits cardiac reserve, which can lead to symptoms of exercise intolerance, and ultimately muscle wasting, loss of independence, and pulmonary venous congestion (Borlaug, 2014). Rapamycin has been shown to reverse age‐related diastolic dysfunction in rodents (Chiao et al., 2016; Luck, DeMarco, Mahmood, Gavini, & Pulakat, 2017) and dogs (Urfer et al., 2017). However, thus far there have not been studies that include both sexes and test for the persistence of the rapamycin‐dependent improvement. Our work indicates that in C57BL/6NIA mice, rapamycin can persistently improve diastolic function in aged animals of both sexes, even 8 weeks after cessation of an 8‐week treatment. We also explored possible mechanisms for this persistent benefit.\n3.1. Echocardiography, hypertrophy, and stiffness\nBoth sexes of C57BL/6 mice show age‐related diastolic dysfunction, which is partially reversed by rapamycin treatment. This occurred in the absence of systolic changes in females and with only small changes in systolic function in males. Furthermore, this improvement was persistent for two months after drug removal. This is an exciting finding because it suggests that future treatments for diastolic dysfunction may be transient, potentially reducing cost, side effects (Pallet & Legendre, 2013; Verhave et al., 2014), and other negative effects of chronic drug treatment.\nRapamycin treatment also reduced cardiac hypertrophy, as previously found. Persistence of this effect was smaller than that of diastolic function, although it was significant when sexes were combined. Passive stiffness of the LV trabeculae was persistently reduced in the rapamycin‐treated animals. Reduction in hypertrophy and stiffness together indicate that at least some of the improvement in diastolic function was due to an improvement in passive filling (dependent on elastic properties of the tissue), rather than active (energy‐ and calcium sequestration‐dependent) relaxation of the left ventricle. This did not appear to be related to changes in cardiac fibrosis. Literature in the area of rapamycin and cardiac stiffness is sparse, but at least one paper suggested that rapamycin can decrease large artery stiffness in aged mice (Lesniewski et al., 2017). Further study is needed to determine which extracellular matrix or cellular changes are altered by rapamycin in the myocardium. Another potential source of increased passive stiffness is changes in myofilaments and their posttranslational modification, especially phosphorylation of key sites (Stienen, 2015); these also remain open for future study.\n3.2. Proteomics and ETC activity\nWe interpreted the large proteomic abundance changes seen after 10‐week rapamycin treatment in previous experiments as evidence of improved proteostasis in the myocardium and postulated that these effects might remain persistent after cessation of the drug. Using shotgun proteomics (MS/MS), we found sex‐specific differences in protein abundance with rapamycin treatment, and while these differences were highly persistent in females after cessation of treatment, they were less so in males. The IPA pathway most significantly affected by rapamycin treatment in both sexes was mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation. Within this category, many of the proteins found to be significantly altered were related to Complex I of the ETC, as either assembly factors, core proteins, or accessory proteins. This led us to hypothesize that there are activity‐level changes to the ETC, or at least to Complex I, with rapamycin treatment.\nWe found that both sexes had persistent decreases in ETC complex activities with rapamycin (Figure 4). CI activity was significantly reduced with rapamycin in male mice, and CIII was reduced in females. These changes were not coordinated with the abundance proteomics. However, we reasoned that the ratio of activity to abundance of proteins involved in CI and CIII might be coordinately altered by rapamycin treatment in both males and females, which proved to be the case (Figure 5). In both sexes, this change (a reduction in activity:abundance ratio) was also persistently reduced in CI, and a similar effect was seen in CIII in females. Thus, both the males and females may have accomplished a similar functional outcome via modulating the relationship of ETC activity and abundance.\nBoth CI and CIII have been implicated as prominent sources of ROS in mitochondria, and an increase in ΔΨM has also been shown to lead to an increase in ROS in myocardial cells, especially at higher ΔΨM (Zhou & Chen, 2014). This may be in part due to higher ΔΨM driving reverse electron flux through the respiratory chain, primarily through Complex I (Selivanov et al., 2011). Rapamycin has been previously demonstrated to reduce ΔΨM (Schieke et al., 2006). This information, especially combined with various clinical and animal model studies that demonstrate an increase in ROS generation in HF (Chen & Knowlton, 2010), suggests that in old hearts, rapamycin may persistently reduce the electron flux through the respiratory chain, leading to a reduced ROS generation, with subsequent beneficial effects.\nThere are additional reports that rapamycin may be abrogating levels of ROS through manipulation of CI and CIII. Martínez‐Cisuelo and colleagues published that 16‐month‐old mice showed age‐related increase in ROS production at CI in liver mitochondria, and this was abrogated by 7‐week rapamycin treatment (Martinez‐Cisuelo et al., 2016). Further, CIII ROS generation, at least in adipocyte differentiation, is dependent on mTORC1 signaling (Tormos et al., 2011). Still, more groups have found that mitochondrial ROS levels decrease with inhibition of TOR or mTORC1 (Xia, Sun, Xie, & Shu, 2017) and that this is associated with changes in ETC complex abundance (Pan & Shadel, 2009). Combined with previous work from our laboratory demonstrating a reduction in protein carbonylation in rapamycin‐treated old hearts (Dai et al., 2014), we speculate that the observed changes in CI and CIII activity and abundance may be coordinated to reduce mitochondrial ROS. Studies that directly test this hypothesis are needed to more fully understand the connection between ETC complex activity and abundance and rapamycin's organ‐wide functional improvement.\n3.3. Metabolomics\nOur laboratory has previously shown that 10‐week rapamycin treatment reverses the age‐related metabolic switch from dependence on FAO (beta‐oxidation, FAO) to glycolysis. Since this change was concurrent with improved diastolic function, we analyzed global metabolomics to see whether this shift was persistent 8 weeks after drug removal. While we found some evidence of the switch to glycolysis occurring in the cohorts in this study, those changes did not persist 8 weeks later—all old groups from both sexes (continuous rapamycin and persistence) were indistinguishable from each other at this time point. Thus, the metabolomes of the 16‐week rapamycin‐treated animals (28 month of age at that time) seemed to revert back to resembling the old control animals. Other studies have indicated that rapamycin's effects on glucose metabolism and insulin regulation are also phasic and reversible (Blum, 2002; Liu et al., 2014). While the metabolomic profile change that is evident within the first few weeks of rapamycin treatment (Chiao et al., 2016) may be important for diastolic functional improvement, it does not appear to be necessary for the persistent benefits. These data emphasize the importance at studying the kinetics of phenotypes, rather than single time points, when trying to determine possible mechanisms of drug effects.\n4. CONCLUSION\nWe have found that rapamycin treatment in vivo leads to a persistent improvement in diastolic function, with mechanism that includes reduction of passive stiffness of the left ventricle, changes in the cardiac proteome, and a reduction in cardiac hypertrophy. Diastolic function can also be modulated by energy‐dependent processes, including calcium reuptake; we observed persistent changes in both sexes in the relationship of ETC activity and abundance, although how this may affect diastolic function needs to be more directly examined.\nWe also observed considerable sexual dimorphism in cellular and molecular changes due to rapamycin; thus, changes that are concordant and persistent in both sexes may provide a focus to best explain the mechanisms of rapamycin benefits, as well as those of other new therapies and more targeted approaches.\nThe goal of any treatment in humans is to maximize the benefits while minimizing the undesirable effects, with as low and infrequent of dosing as possible. To that end, many clinical studies have monitored the side effects of rapamycin treatment (Pallet & Legendre, 2013; Verhave et al., 2014) and animal model studies have sought to modulate those by either changing treatment duration or amount (Bitto et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2014). Most side effects of rapamycin are, however, reversible upon cessation of treatment (Kaplan, Qazi, & Wellen, 2014), although this was not addressed in the present study. Our work thus reinforces the approach of minimizing potential detrimental side effects of rapamycin treatment by utilizing an intermittent dosing regimen. Our results complement the prior body of work by showing that transient rapamycin treatment may be sufficient to confer a longer‐term health benefit.\n5. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n5.1. Animals and husbandry\nC57BL/6J female and male mice (3–28 months old) from the National Institute of Aging (NIA; originating from Charles River) were housed and maintained according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Washington. Both sexes began treatment at the 75% survival mark for the National Institutes of Aging colony of C57BL/6 mice (Turturro et al., 1999), 24 (male) or 22 (female) months of age. Animals were randomized and divided into three experimental groups. Treated animals received EUDRAGIT encapsulated rapamycin (purchased from the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio) at 42 ppm (males) or 14 ppm (females) in standard chow (rapa group), or EUDRAGIT encapsulation alone in the chow (control group), for 8 or 16 weeks. The persistence group received rapamycin chow for 8 weeks, followed by control chow for a further 8 weeks. Young mice of the same genotype were acquired from the NIA at 3 months and used for the studies at 4 months of age. Animals were removed from the study whenever one of the several possible conditions was met: (a) loss of 20% body weight, (b) tumors or masses interfered with daily activity, or (c) inability to feed or drink with signs of impending death. Three of each old male group were censored. Censored old females included were six control, one rapa, and two persistence mice. No young animals were censored. Diet was prepared in house, by combining powdered standard rodent diet (LabDiet PicoLab Rodent Diet 20, #5053) with food coloring, agar, water, and either EUDRAGIT or encapsulated rapamycin. This mix was then compressed into patties and frozen until used. Animals had ad libitum access to food and water with a 12‐hr light/dark cycle. Experimental animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation. A 2‐mm mid‐vertical section was fixed in 4% formalin with the remainder of the tissue minced and flash‐frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN2). Frozen tissue was powdered with a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) and stored in LN2 until use.\n5.2. Echocardiography\nLongitudinal echocardiography occurred 0, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after start of treatment. Mice were anesthetized with 1%–2% isoflurane to keep the heart rate between 500 and 550 bpm. Breathing and heart rates were continuously monitored, and body temperature was kept stable using a circulating warm water pad. Images were captured using a 13 MHz probe with a Siemens Acuson CV‐70 (Siemens Medical Solution), using M‐mode and B‐mode views along with LV parasternal long‐axis view (D‐mode and TDI). Images taken when the heart rate was not within the 500–550 bpm range were excluded from analysis.\n5.3. Proteomics\nFlash‐frozen and pulverized heart tissues were processed and trypsin‐digested, and LC‐MS/MS analysis was performed with a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC and an Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer. For detailed methods on tissue processing, see Supplementary Methods.\nStatistical analyses were performed using R (R Core Team, 2016) and Bioconductor (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). R scripts used in the proteomic analysis pipeline are available upon request from the corresponding author. Peptides that mapped to a single UniProt (Apweiler et al., 2004) protein accession for Mus musculus were used for quantification of protein abundance. A total of 31,791 entries (male dataset) and 27,165 entries (female dataset) from UniProtKB/Swiss‐Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL were found. Where one protein consisted of multiple peptides, statistical models were modified to appropriately account for this by using the peptides in each protein as a blocking factor. The total number of proteins found is as follows: 7,166 (males) and 5,870 (females). Statistically significant abundance changes in proteins between groups were determined by Student's t test, and p‐values were corrected for multiple testing by calculating q‐values; q‐values under 0.05 were considered statistically significant. See Supporting Information for detailed methods on pathway analysis and creation of heatmaps.\n5.4. Passive stiffness\nExperiments were performed as described in Moussavi‐Harami et al. (2015). In brief, excised hearts were demembranated overnight at 4°C in a relaxing solution (in mM: 100 KCl, 10 imidazole, 2 EGTA, 5 MgCl2, and 4 ATP) containing 50% glycerol (vol:vol), 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma‐Aldrich, P8340), and 1% Triton X‐100. Hearts were then stored at −20°C in the same solution without Triton X‐100 for up to 1 week. LV multicellular tissues were dissected out and wrapped between aluminum t‐clips, then mounted between a motor (Aurora Scientific, Model 312B) and force transducer (Aurora Scientific, Model 403A). Preparations were moved to a bath containing experimental relaxing solution at pH 7.0 and 15°C containing (in mM): 15 phosphocreatine, 15 EGTA, 80 MOPS, 1 free Mg2+, 10–6 Ca2+, 1 DTT, and 5 Mg2 ATP. Preparations were set to length just above slack (L0), then sequentially stretched at 4% increments up to 24% L0. We calculated median passive force (mN/mm2) per mouse from multiple preparations (1–4 per heart). We scaled all data to controls at 24% length change for each experiment to compare 3 experiments at once. N = 3–12 mice per group. Scaled data were log‐transformed, and linear modeling was performed. p‐values are from linear modeling. All groups have both sexes combined. We did not observe sex‐related differences.\n5.5. Picrosirius red staining\nFormalin‐fixed/paraffin‐embedded mid‐ventricle sections from each heart were counterstained to visualize nuclei with Weigert's hematoxylin (MilliporeSigma) and then stained with 0.1% sirius red in saturated picric acid (Rowley Biochemical). Slides were briefly washed in acidified water (87 mmol glacial acetic acid), dehydrated, and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific). All images were obtained with the same exposure time, white balance, and saturation on a Leica DMLS outfitted with a circular polarizer and a AmScope MU 300 camera.\nPositive picrosirius red signal and total tissue area were quantified in ImageJ. Percent positive signal was determined for each image (n = 8–22 images per heart), and median % positive signal was calculated per animal. N per group: C‐6, P‐6, R‐4, and Y‐2.\n5.6. Metabolite extraction and analysis\nMetabolic profiling by LC‐MS was performed as previously described (Dai et al., 2014). For detailed tissue extraction methods, see Supplementary Methods.\nData were log2‐transformed, centered and scaled (by standard deviation), and then analyzed using one‐way ANOVA per sex and metabolite in R. Sample sizes for each group (old control, old rapa, old persistence, and young controls) were 8, 8, 8, and 6 (females) and 8, 7, 8, and 7 (males).\n5.7. Statistical analysis\nFor specific statistical analyses, see each methods subsection. In general, all tests involving one sex with more than two groups were one‐way ANOVAs. Two‐way ANOVA with repeated measures was used, when one sex with more than two groups was tested over multiple time points (i.e., for Ea/Aa ratios). Following ANOVAs, Tukey's post hoc tests were used to determine group–group differences. Student's t tests or Welch two‐sample tests were used when comparing two groups. Multiple testing corrections were performed using the Bioconductor package q‐value. p‐values and q‐values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\nAUTHORS' CONTRIBUTIONS\nEQ and PSR designed the study.

This observation resulted in a sea-change in how researchers viewed aging. This was the first evidence that a pharmacological agent could have an impact on aging when administered later in life, i.e., an intervention that did not have to be implemented early in life before the negative impact of aging. Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in the number of reports studying the effect of rapamycin on various diseases, physiological functions, and biochemical processes in mice. In this review, we focus on those areas in which there is strong evidence for rapamycin’s effect on aging and age-related diseases in mice, e.g., lifespan, cardiac disease/function, central nervous system, immune system, and cell senescence. We conclude that it is time that pre-clinical studies be focused on taking rapamycin to the clinic, e.g., as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.\nKeywords: Rapamycin, Aging, Neurodegeneration, Lifespan, Cancer, Heart\nIntroduction\nRapamycin (also known by the trade names of sirolimus or rapamune) is a macrocyclic lactone produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus, which was isolated from soil samples collected from Easter Island by Georges Nogrady in the late 1960s [1]. Scientists at Ayerst Pharmaceuticals in Canada discovered that Streptomyces hygroscopicus produced a compound that would kill fungi, which they named rapamycin after the name of Easter Island, Rapa Nui. The initial interest in rapamycin focused on its antifungal properties. When it was found that rapamycin inhibited the growth of eukaryote cells, research on rapamycin turned to rapamycin’s immunosuppressive and anticancer properties. Rapamycin was approved by the FDA in 1994 to prevent organ rejection in liver transplant patients. In addition to being used as an antirejection drug, rapamycin or its rapalogs are being used today to prevent restenosis after coronary angioplasty, and they are being tested in many clinical trials as antitumor agents, e.g., FDA approved the use of rapamycin in treatment of pancreatic cancer patients in 2011.\nResearch in the late 1980s turned to identifying the mechanism by which rapamycin blocked the growth of eukaryote cells. Heitman et al. [2] discovered the protein, target of rapamycin (TOR), in yeast that was responsible for rapamycin’s ability to inhibit growth. Three groups in 1994 independently identified the mammalian counterpart, mTOR [3–5]. TOR, a serine/threonine kinase, was found to be a master-regulator in the response of eukaryote cells to nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy status, and this is now known as the TOR pathway. Harrison et al. [6] in 2009 reported that rapamycin increased the lifespan of both male and female mice. This was a major discovery in aging because it was the first evidence that the lifespan of a mammal could be significantly increased by a pharmacological agent. The journal, Science, selected this study as one of the major scientific break-throughs in 2009 (Science 326, 1598–1607), the first discovery in aging to be selected by Science as a break-through. Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in the number of reports studying the effect of rapamycin on aging and age-related diseases, and there have been several reviews describing various aspects of rapamycin on aging [7–11]. In this article, we review the data collected over the past decade on the effect of rapamycin on lifespan and age-related diseases.\nEffect of rapamycin on the lifespan of mice\nThe first data suggesting that rapamycin might affect longevity came from studies with invertebrates. In 2003, Vellai et al. [12] showed that a TOR mutation increased the lifespan of Caenorhabditis\nelegans, and other groups showed that mutations in TOR increased the lifespan of yeast [13] and Drosophila [14]. Subsequently, it was found that rapamycin increased lifespan in yeast [15]. Based on these data, David Sharp (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio) proposed that the NIA Intervention Testing Program tests the effect of feeding rapamycin to mice. The study was initiated in 2006, and in 2009, Harrison et al. [6] reported the first data showing that feeding rapamycin (14 ppm or ~ 2.24 mg/kg based on average food consumption of mice) increased the lifespan of both male and female mice. Not only was this the first report to show that lifespan could be increased pharmacologically in both male and female mice, but more importantly, the increase in lifespan was observed when rapamycin was given to mice late in life (19 months). Up to this time, it was generally believed that initiating an intervention late life would have minimal impact on longevity, i.e., the manipulation would need to be initiated early in life before major age-related decrements occurred and the intervention maintained the rest of life. Interestingly, the increase in lifespan by rapamycin was similar when implemented at 4 months [16], 9 months [17], or 19 months [6] of age. Since the initial report in 2009, there have been fourteen additional studies showing that rapamycin increased the lifespans of male and female mice. As shown in Table 1, the effect of rapamycin on lifespan is robust because it has been replicated in many different laboratories with different strains of laboratory mice, ranging from inbred strains (e.g., C57BL/6 and 129) to the UM-HET3 mice (a heterogeneous strain of mice generated by a 4-way cross) and with different rapamycin dosing regimens. Only the study by Bitto et al. [20] reported that rapamycin had no effect on lifespan. At a high dose (8 mg/kg/day) given i.p., rapamycin had no effect of lifespan of female mice; however, this dose and route of rapamycin increased the lifespan of male rats 61%. On the other hand, 126 ppm of rapamycin given in the diet increased the lifespan of both female and male mice 39% and 45%, respectively. To our knowledge, there currently is no report showing that rapamycin has a negative effect on the lifespan of normal, laboratory strains of mice.\nTable 1.\nEffect of rapamycin on lifespan of various strains of mice\n126 ppm*\n8 mg/kg i.p. daily#\n45% M–39% F\n61% M–0% F\n*Rapamycin given in the diet\n^Rapamycin given for 2 weeks and then not given rapamycin for 2 weeks\n#Rapamycin given for only 3 months\n@Rapamycin given 5 days/week\n+Rapamycin given every other day for 6 weeks\n++Rapamycin given every other day\nThree additional points of interest with respect to rapamycin’s longevity affect can be seen from Table 1. First, rapamycin is effective over a wide dose range. Even at high doses, it does not have a negative effect on lifespan. Second, rapamycin increases the lifespan of both male and female mice, which is unique because of all of the other anti-aging interventions identified by the NIA Intervention Testing Program are sex specific, i.e., they significantly increased lifespan in one sex but have little or no effect on the other sex [18]. However, as the data in Table 1 show, the increase in lifespan is greater in female mice than male mice in those studies that have compared the effect of rapamycin on lifespan in both males and females. However, this difference becomes minimal at high doses of rapamycin [19, 20]. Thus, it appears that female mice tend to be more sensitive to the life-extending actions of rapamycin. Third, the study by Bitto et al. [20] showed that only 3 months of a high dose of rapamycin (126 ppm) late in life was able to increase lifespan dramatically, again pointing to the late life benefits of rapamycin as well as showing that rapamycin need not be continuously administered to mice for a beneficial effect.\nTable 2 lists the studies showing that rapamycin significantly increased the lifespan of genetic mouse models that mimic various diseases in humans. Most of these studies used mouse models of accelerated cancer, and as would be expected, these studies show an increase in lifespan as well as reduction in the progression of the neoplastic tumors specific to each model. These studies are described in more detail below. In addition, five studies have used mouse models of other disease phenotypes. Using a mouse model (Lmna−/−) that mimics Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Ramos et al. [21] showed that rapamycin increased lifespan over 50% and improved cardiac and skeletal muscle function in the Lmna−/− mice. Khapre et al. [22] studied the effect of rapamycin on the lifespan of Bmal1−/− mice because knocking out Bmal1 (a transcription factor that is key to the circadian clock) increased mTORC1 activity and reduced lifespan and disrupted circadian rhythm. They showed that rapamycin increased the lifespan of the Bmal1−/− mice leading Khapre et al. [22] to propose that the regulation of mTORC1 activity by Bmal1 is key to the circadian clock. Two groups have studied the effect of rapamycin on mouse models with mutations leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Siegmund et al. [23] studied TK2KI/KI mice, which have a nuclear mutation in the mitochondrial nucleotide salvage enzyme thymidine kinase resulting in reduced replication of mtDNA and mtDNA instability. Rapamycin dramatically increased the lifespan of the TK2KI/KI without having any detectable improvement in mitochondrial dysfunction. The authors concluded that rapamycin enhanced longevity in the TK2KI/KI mice through alternative energy reserves and/or triggering indirect signaling events. Johnson et al. [7] initially showed that rapamycin attenuated mitochondrial disease symptoms and progression in Ndufs4−/− mice, which lack a subunit in mitochondria complex I and is a mouse model of Leigh syndrome. Johnson et al. [24] subsequently showed that rapamycin increased the lifespan of the Ndufs4−/− mice, especially at very high doses of rapamycin, which were 28-fold higher than the dose of rapamycin initially showed to increase the lifespan of mice by Harrison et al. [6]. Reifsnyder et al. [25] studied a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, the BKS-Leprdb mouse. They found that rapamycin doubled the lifespan of female mice but had no effect of the lifespan of male mice. Rapamycin improved both kidney and cardiac functions in the female BKS-Leprdb mice.\nTable 2.\nEffect of rapamycin on lifespan of various mouse models of human disease\n*Given in diet unless otherwise indicated\n^Everolimus given by gavage 5 times a week\n#Given 3 times a week for a period of 2 weeks followed by 2-week intervals without rapamycin\n@Given 5 days followed by 9-day interval without treatment\n+Given to dams at 0.8 mg/kg before weaning\nAlthough the overwhelming majority of studies on the effect of rapamycin on longevity in mice have shown a significant increase in lifespan, there are five studies that have reported either no effect or reduced lifespan when treated with rapamycin. Two studies using transgenic mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (G93A and H46R/H48Q) reported no increase in lifespan when given rapamycin [26, 27]. Sataranatarajan et al. [28] reported that 14 ppm, a dose of rapamycin that increases the lifespan of C57BL/6 mice, reduced the lifespan of the obese and diabetic C57BL/KsJleprdb/db mice, 13% in males and 15% in females. The reduced lifespan of the db/db mice by rapamycin was associated with an increase in suppurative inflammation, which was the primary cause of death in the db/db mice. Ferrara-Romeo et al. [29] reported that 42 ppm rapamycin reduced the lifespan of telomerase-deficient mice (G2-Terc−/−) 16% compared with over a 50% increase in the lifespan of the G2-Terc+/+ mice. Fang et al. [30] found that rapamycin reduced the lifespan of growth hormone receptor knockout (GHR-KO) mice (15% for males and 5% for females) even though the same dose of rapamycin increased the lifespan of the wild-type, control mice. The reduced lifespan of the GHR-KO mice was associated with impaired glucose and lipid homeostasis and increased inflammation.\nEffect of rapamycin on cancer in mouse models\nRapamycin would be predicted to reduce the progression of cancer because it has been shown to inhibit cell growth and proliferation. In addition, mTOR is frequently hyperactivated in cancer, and mTORC1 has often been observed to be deregulated in a wide variety of human cancers [31]. Data generated in the 3 years after the discovery that rapamycin increased lifespan in 2009 showed that rapamycin and rapalogs (e.g., everolimus, temsirolimus, ridaforolimus) attenuated various cancers induced in mice. A few of these studies are summarized in Table 3 showing that mTOR inhibitors have an antineoplastic effect on a broad range of cancers. For example, Rivera et al. [32] studied the effect of ridaforolimus on the growth of various human tumor xenografts in mice. They showed that the administration of ridaforolimus inhibited the growth of prostate (PC-3), colon (HCT-116), breast (MCF7), lung (A549), and pancreas (PANC-1) cancer cells.\nTable 3.\nAbility of mTOR inhibitors to reduce cancer\n55% ↓ in tumor volume\n40% ↓ in cell proliferation\nThe data in Table 2 show the effect of rapamycin (or everolimus) on the survival of various mouse models with genetically engineered mutations in genes involved in cancer. Particularly striking are the three studies with APCMin/+ (ApcD716) mice, which are a model of human colorectal cancer. Most human colorectal cancers have somatic mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene, and APCMin/+ mice develop multiple intestinal neoplasia. The APCMin/+ mice are relatively short lived, living a maximum of ~ 200 days compared with 800 to 900 days for normal laboratory mice. Three groups [33–35] showed that treating APCMin/+ mice with rapamycin or everolimus reduced intestinal neoplasia (polyp number and size) in the APCMin/+ mice. In addition, these studies showed that rapamycin or everolimus dramatically increased the lifespan of the APCMin/+ mice. For example, Hasty et al. [35] found that a high level of rapamycin (42 ppm) resulted in a lifespan longer than that observed in normal laboratory mice, over a fourfold increase in lifespan of the APCMin/+ mice.\nThree groups have studied the effect of rapamycin on mice with deletions in the p53 gene, a transcription factor with broad biological functions, including as a tumor suppressor in humans [36]. Komarova et al. [37] and Christy et al. [38] found that rapamycin treatment resulted in a modest, but significant increase in the lifespan of p53+/− mice. Komarova et al. [37] reported that rapamycin reduced the incidence of tumors in the p53+/− mice; however, Christy et al. [38] did not observe any significant changes in tumor incidence in p53+/− mice treated with rapamycin. Comas et al. [39] reported that rapamycin increased the lifespan of p53−/− mice; however, Christy et al. [38] did not observe a significant increase in the lifespan of p53−/− mice.\nTwo reports have described the effect of rapamycin on transgenic mice overexpressing Her-2/neu. HER2 is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family and amplification/overexpression of this oncogene has been shown to play a role in certain types of breast cancer. Rapamycin treatment resulted in a modest, but significant increase in the lifespan of Her-2/neu transgenic mice [40, 41] and dramatically delayed the incidence of tumors in the Her-2/neu transgenic mice. Hernando et al. [42] reported that everolimus dramatically increased the lifespan of Ptet−/− mice, a model of leiomyosarcomas. The Ptet−/− mice develop widespread smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and abdominal leiomyosarcomas, and everolimus significantly reduced the growth rate of these tumors. Livi et al. [43] studied the effect of rapamycin on Rb1+/− mice. The retinoblastoma gene (Rb1) was the first tumor suppressor gene identified in humans and prevents excessive cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression. Rapamycin increased the lifespan of the Rb1+/− mice and reduced the incidence of thyroid C cell carcinomas as well as delaying the appearance and reducing the size of pituitary tumors. Hurez et al. [44] studied the effect of rapamycin on immunocompromised, cancer prone Rag2−/−, and IFN-γ−/− mice. Cancer immune surveillance is reduced in these two mouse models and rapamycin increased the lifespan of both Rag2−/−\nand IFN-γ−/− mice; however, no data were presented on the effect of rapamycin on the incidence of tumors in these mice.\nEffect of rapamycin on cardiac function and disease in mice\nThe first indication that rapamycin might be important for the heart was the discovery that coronary stents coated with rapamycin prevented restenosis and stent thrombosis compared with non-coated or other drug-eluting stents [45], which led to FDA approval in 2003. Two other mTOR inhibitors (everolimus and zotarolimus) are currently used to prevent restenosis and thrombosis in patients who require coronary stents [46].\nThe effect of rapamycin and rapalogs on the cardiovascular system initially was not clear, especially in humans. In clinical studies with transplant patients, rapalogs induced a negative plasma cardiovascular risk profile, e.g., an increase in LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in plasma [47]. Rapamycin also has been reported to have deleterious effects on endothelial function (ability of a blood vessel to constrict and dilate) in laboratory animals and in human coronary arteries from sirolimus-eluting stents [48, 49]. Rapamycin also has been reported to accelerate senescence of endothelial progenitor cells [50]; however, as described below, most of the recent studies indicate that rapamycin reduces cellular senescence. Overall, these early studies are in conflict with the large number of studies in mice listed in Table 4 that have studied the effect of rapamycin on atherosclerosis in mice.\nTable 4.\nEffect of rapamycin on heart disease and function in rodents\n*The sex of the mice was not given\nTable 4 lists the studies that have examined the effect of rapamycin (or everolimus) on various aspects of heart disease/function in mice. Four groups have studied the effect of rapamycin or everolimus on the occurrence of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch of either ApoE−/− or LDLR−/− mice fed a high-fat diet to induce atherosclerotic plaque formation. All four studies showed that rapamycin reduced aortic atheromas, and Jahrling et al. [51] found that this was paralleled by an improvement in cerebral blood flow and vascular density in LDLR−/− mice fed a high-fat diet. Because treating transplant patients with rapalogs has been shown to increase blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, the four groups also measured blood levels of cholesterol in their mouse models of atherosclerosis. Three found that rapamycin treatment had no effect on blood levels of cholesterol or triglycerides groups [51–53]. Mueller et al. [54] reported that the blood levels of LDL and VLDL cholesterol were slightly higher in the everolimus-treated mice but observed no change in triglycerides. It is interesting to note that Ross et al. [55] observed no effect of rapamycin (1.0 mg/kg/day) treatment on blood triglyceride levels in the non-human primate, marmoset.\nA large number of studies have evaluated the effect of rapamycin on cardiomyopathy and hypertrophy induced by physical, pharmacological, or genetic engineering in mice and rats. All nine studies show that rapamycin prevents or attenuates cardiomyopathy or hypertrophy in both mice and rats. Two studies examined the effect everolimus in rats or rapamycin in mice on myocardial infraction [56, 57]. Rapamycin improved cardiac function, reduced infarct size in rats, and reduced hypertrophy and fibrosis in mice.\nThe three studies on the effect of heart function in old mice are the most relevant to this review. The studies by Simon Melov’s group at the Buck Institute [58] and Peter Rabinovitch’s group at the University of Washington [59] showed that rapamycin treatment for 2.5 to 3 months attenuated cardiac dysfunction and reduced cardiac hypertrophy seen with age. In other words, short-term rapamycin treatment was able to reverse cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy that occurred in the old mice. The ability of rapamycin to improve cardiac function is not limited to mice. Urfer et al. [60] showed that giving rapamycin (0.1 mg/kg, 3 times/week) for 10 weeks to middle-aged companion dogs improved both systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Recently, Rabinovitch’s group showed that the improvement in diastolic function after 2 months of rapamycin treatment of old mice persisted for 2 months after rapamycin treatment was discontinued, demonstrating that rapamycin can have lasting effects on cardiac function even after it is discontinued [113].\nEffect of rapamycin on the central nervous system of mice\nPerhaps the most unanticipated aspect of rapamycin’s biological effects, besides its anti-aging actions, is its impact on the central nervous system in mice. The limited number of early studies suggested that rapamycin might have negative effects on memory because of its effect on protein synthesis [61]. However, as shown in Table 5, the current data overwhelmingly show that rapamycin has a positive effect on a variety of functions and diseases of the central nervous system. Salvatore Oddo and Veronica Galvan at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio independently reported the seminal studies in this area in 2010 when they showed rapamycin prevented the loss of cognition in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (transgenic AD mouse models). Each laboratory treated a different transgenic AD mouse with the same level of rapamycin that Harrison et al. [6] showed increased lifespan to determine if the longevity effects of rapamycin extended to attenuating Alzheimer’s disease. They found that feeding rapamycin for 2 to 3 months completely blocked the loss of memory in these transgenic AD mice that occurred at ~ 6 months of age [62, 63]. Subsequently, Oddo’s laboratory showed that the life-long feeding of rapamycin blocked the loss in cognition in old 3xTg-AD mice, i.e., cognition of old 3xTg-AD mice was not significantly different from old wild-type mice. The initial studies by the laboratories of Oddo and Galvan also showed that rapamycin treatment reduced the accumulation of Aβ aggregates in the brains of their transgenic AD mice [62, 63], which was expected because inhibition of mTOR signaling had been shown to induce autophagy [64]. Oddo’s laboratory also showed that rapamycin prevented tau pathology (tau phosphorylation) in the 3xTg-AD mice [62, 65]. Rapamycin was also found to prevent tau pathology in tau-specific mouse models, which overexpress human mutant tau genes [66, 67]. Galvan’s laboratory also showed that rapamycin restored cerebral blood flow and vascular density [127] and prevented the breakdown of the blood brain barrier in hAPP (J20) mice [158]. Thus, rapamycin has a global impact on the central nervous system in maintaining cognition in transgenic AD mice. It reduces Aβ and tau pathology, increases cerebral blood flow and vascularization, preserves the brain blood barrier, and reduces neuroinflammation by attenuating microglia and astrocyte activation [9].\nTable 5.\nEffect of rapamycin on the central nervous system of mice\n  C57BL/6JRj\nF344BNF1 rats\n14 ppm\n42 ppm (5 months) and then 14 ppm (10 months)\nCognition improved in 11- and 20-month-old mice\nImproved cognition, neurovascular uncoupling, and cerebral perfusion in 35-month-old rats\n[79]\n[80]\n*Used the rapalog, temsirolimus\nRapamycin has also been shown to affect mouse models related to Alzheimer’s disease. The apolipoprotein Eε4 allele (APOE4) is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease in humans; individuals with one or two copies of this allele have a fourfold to eightfold increased risk in developing Alzheimer’s disease [68]. Using transgenic mice expressing the human APOE4 gene, Lin et al. [69] showed that rapamycin improved CBF, blood brain barrier integrity, and cognition deficits in these mice. More recently, Tramutola et al. [70] studied the effect of rapamycin on Down syndrome, a genetic disease of trisomy 21 in which individuals develop Alzheimer-like dementia. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (Ts65Dn mice), they showed that internasal delivery of rapamycin improved cognition of the Ts65Dn mice and reduced aberrant amyloid precursor protein levels and tau pathology.\nAs shown in Table 5, rapamycin has also been shown to have an impact on two other types of neurodegeneration: Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease. Several studies have reported that rapamycin prevents various aspects of Parkinson’s disease in different mouse models of Parkinson’s disease. For example, rapamycin prevented the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH+) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta [71, 72] and improved various measures of muscle coordination [72, 73]. Ravikumar et al. [74] showed that rapamycin protected against Huntington’s disease. Using both a Drosophila (yw;gmr-Q120 line) and a mouse model (HD-N171-N82Q) of Huntington’s disease, they showed that rapamycin attenuated the polyglutamine (polyQ) toxicity in yw;gmr-Q120 Drosophila and enhanced various tests of motor performance in HD-N171-N82Q mice. Berger et al. [75] and King et al. [76] showed that treating cells that expressed polyQ with rapamycin enhanced the clearance of polyQ aggregates. Berger et al. [75] found similar results with Drosophila expressing polyQ proteins and showed that rapamycin was protective against tau protein in Drosophila. Sarkar et al. (2008) showed that lithium and rapamycin exert an additive protective effect against neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of Huntington’s disease.\nIn addition to its positive effect on neurodegeneration, rapamycin also has a neuroprotective effective effect on neurovascular disease, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental disorders (Table 5). Of particular interest to this review was the unexpected observation that rapamycin attenuated the age-related decline in cognition in normal mice. Again, the laboratories of Veronica Galvan and Salvatore Oddo were the first to independently and simultaneously report that old mice treated with rapamycin showed a significant improvement in cognition. Galvan’s laboratory studied the effect of feeding rapamycin (14 ppm) on the cognition of C57BL/6 mice at 8 and 25 months of age [77]. Eight-month-old male mice treated with rapamycin for 4 months showed a significant improvement in cognition measured by the Morris water maze. When 25-month-old mice (combined males and females) were fed rapamycin starting at 21 months of age, a significant improvement in cognition as measured by passive avoidance test (response to a mild foot shock) was observed in the rapamycin-treated mice. Oddo’s laboratory treated mice (sex not given) with 14 ppm rapamycin starting at 2 months of age, and cognition was measured by the Morris water maze at 18 months of age [78]. Rapamycin resulted in a 30–40% improvement in cognition. The improvement in cognition was correlated to reduced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. In contrast, they observed no impact of rapamycin on cognition in 18-month-old mice when rapamycin treatment was started at 15 months of age; however, other groups have reported an improvement in cognition when mice are given rapamycin later in life. Neff et al. [79] replicated the effect of rapamycin on cognition in mice previously reported by Oddo and Galvan. Neff et al. [79] studied the effect of rapamycin (14 ppm) on a variety of measures of cognition (Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and novel object recognition) in male mice. Rapamycin had no effect on the novel object recognition test; however, 11- or 20-month mice treated with rapamycin for 6 weeks performed significantly better on the Morris water maze than mice fed the control diets, and mice (15, 24, and 33 months old) treated with rapamycin for 12 weeks performed significantly better on the passive avoidance test. More recently, Galvan’s group studied the effect of rapamycin on various parameters of brain function in old rats [80]. They found that treating rats with rapamycin (42 ppm for 5 months and 14 ppm for 10 months) starting at 19 months of age prevented deficits in learning and memory, prevented neurovascular uncoupling, and restored cerebral perfusion in 34-month-old rats. They argued that changes in the brain with normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease involve a vascular mechanism and that rapamycin improves vascular integrity and function in normal aging and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease.\nAn interesting observation came from the study by Halloran et al. [77] when they observed that rapamycin has a significant effect on behavior of male C57BL/6 mice. Rapamycin (14 ppm) reduced anxiety-like behavior (thigmotaxis and elevated plus maze) and depressive-like behavior (floating and tail suspension test) in 4- and 12-month-old mice. As shown in Table 5, several studies report that rapamycin reduced behavioral deficits such as anxiety and depression in mouse models of autism [81–84]. However, Hadamitzky et al. [85, 86] reported that rapamycin (3 mg/kg, i.p.) induced anxiety-like behaviors (elevated plus maze, open field) when given to young rats (DA/HanRj).\nEffect of rapamycin on the immune response to infectious agents in mice\nBecause rapamycin was first developed as part of a cocktail to prevent rejection in transplant patients, it is generally assumed that rapamycin is an immunosuppressant. Therefore, when it was observed that rapamycin increased the longevity of mice, there were questions about the translatability of using rapamycin to delay aging in humans because of its potential negative effect on the immune system. However, it is now recognized that rapamycin is best identified as an immunomodulator rather than an immunosuppressant [44, 87]. Because of its use in transplant patients and its potential anti-aging role, there has been a large number of studies on the effect of rapamycin and mTOR signaling on various aspects of the immune system, and there have been several recent review articles in this area [88–91]. In this review, we will focus on those studies that have evaluated the effect of rapamycin treatment on the ability of an animal to respond to an antigen/vaccine or infectious agent.\nTable 6 shows that the overwhelming majority of cases show that rapamycin provided protection from a variety of infectious agents starting with the first study by Weichhart et al. [92]. Jagannath et al. [93] and Araki et al. [94] were the first groups to report that rapamycin increased vaccine efficacy in mice, which protected the animals from subsequent infection. The ability of rapamycin to increase vaccine efficacy has been shown by many groups [93, 95]. Araki et al. [94] also showed that rapamycin enhanced vaccine response in Rhesus macaques to the modified Ankara virus vaccine. More recently, Mannick et al. [96] showed that the response to the influenza vaccination was improved in human subjects ≥ 65 years of age with 6 weeks of treatment with the rapalog, RAD001. Patients receiving rapamycin also had higher antibody titers to influenza virus vaccine a year later [97].\nTable 6.\nEffect of rapamycin on the immune response to antigens/vaccines and infectious agents\n  C57BL/6\nM, 8–12 weeks\n  C57BL/6\nM, 6–8 weeks\n  C57BL/6 M and F\n22–24 months\n  C57BL/6\n8–12 weeks\n  C57BL/6\n8–12 weeks\n  C57BL/6\nF, 6–8 weeks\n  C57BL/6\nF, 10 weeks\n  Cd1d−/−\nF, 10 weeks\n  RAG2−/−\n3 months\n  C57BL/6\nM, 6 weeks\n  C57BL/6\nM, 16–18 months\n*Immunized mice with dendritic cells treated with 1 mM rapamycin for 2 h\nOne of the limitations in the current studies evaluating the effect of rapamycin on infectious agents is that almost all of the studies have used young mice (under 3 months of age). Two groups studied the effect of a same dose and formulation of rapamycin (14 ppm) used by Harrison et al. [6] on resistance to infectious agents in old mice. Orihuela’s group studied the effect of the rapamycin on pneumococcal pneumonia induced by Streptococcus pneumonia. Old male C57BL/6 mice (24 months) were treated with rapamycin for 4 or 20 months. Both groups of mice showed improved survival to pneumococcal pneumonia and reduced lung pathology; however, the increased survival was not statistically significant for the mice given rapamycin for 20 months. On the other hand, Goldberg et al. [98] found that treating old (18 months) male C57BL/6 mice for 2 months with rapamycin reduced the survival to West Nile virus (WNV); however, this decrease was not significant. Interestingly, caloric restriction, a manipulation that has been shown to increase lifespan and delay aging animals ranging from invertebrates to non-human primates, showed a greater reduction in survival to WNV than rapamycin. Thus, it is quite possible that rapamycin will have different effects with different infectious agents. This is supported by a study of Ferrer et al. [99] who compared the effect of rapamycin on the antigen-specific T cell response with a bacterial infection versus a transplant. They found that treatment with rapamycin augmented the antigen-specific T cell response to the bacteria but failed to do so when the antigen was presented in the context of a transplant. They concluded that the environment in which an antigen is presented affects the influence of rapamycin on antigen-specific T cell expansion.\nEffect of rapamycin on cell senescence\nIn 1961, Leonard Hayflick described the phenomenon of cell senescence when he showed that human fibroblasts did not grow indefinitely in culture but underwent irreversible growth arrest [100]. It was later shown that the shortening of telomeres was responsible for cellular senescence observed in the fibroblast cultures by triggering a DNA damage response [101]. Subsequently, it was shown that senescence could be induced in a variety of cells, even post-mitotic cells by DNA-damaging agents and activation of oncogenes. A major break-through occurred when Judith Campisi discovered that senescent cells exhibited a senescent associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in which they secreted a variety of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases [102]. Because the number of senescent cells increase with age and the SASPs produced by senescent cells could play a role in the age-related increase in chronic inflammation, cell senescence might be an important mechanism underlying aging [103]. Therefore, investigators began studying whether rapamycin had an effect on cell senescence when it was discovered that rapamycin increased lifespan. Although Imanishi et al. [50] initially reported that rapamycin accelerated senescence of endothelial progenitor cells, the eighteen studies published since 2009 show that cell senescence is attenuated by rapamycin.\nThe studies listed in Table 7 show that rapamycin was able to reduce or block senescence in a variety of cells from humans, mice, and rats. In addition, rapamycin has been shown to be effective in suppressing senescence induced by a variety of agents such as replicative senescence, DNA-damaging agents (e.g., UV and ionizing radiation, H2O2, bleomycin), and oncogene activation. Cao et al. [104] also studied the effect of rapamycin on senescence induced by the accumulation of an abnormal lamin A protein (progerin) in fibroblasts isolated from patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. Rapamycin enhanced the degradation of progerin, abolished nuclear blebbing in the cells, and delayed the onset of cellular senescence.\nTable 7.\nEffect of rapamycin on cell senescence\nHuman\n(cell lines)\nFibroblast\n(WI-38)\nFibrosarcoma\n(HT1080-p-21-9)\nBreast Cancer\n(MCF-7)\nFibroblast\n(HGADFN167)\nMouse\nin vivo\nFibroblast\n(WI-38)\nMice\nin vivo\nZmpste24−/− mice\nin vivo\nMice\nin vivo\nIn addition to suppressing markers of senescence, such as p16 and p21 expressions and SA-β-gal-positive cells, rapamycin reduced/prevented the SASP phenotype, i.e., the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by senescent cells. Two groups independently and simultaneously reported in 2015 that rapamycin reduced SASP produced by senescent human fibroblasts. Campisi’s group at the Buck Institute reported that rapamycin suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines produced by a variety of human cells isolated from different tissues (foreskin, fetal lung, adult prostate, and breast epithelial cells) [105]. Because SASP factors can promote cancer cell proliferation in culture, they studied the effect of media from senescent prostate cancer cells (PSC27) treated or not treated with rapamycin on the growth and migration of various cancer cell lines. They found that rapamycin reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells. They also implanted PSC27 senescent cells with PC3 prostate cancer cells subcutaneously into SCID mice. Rapamycin treatment of the senescent cells before implantation resulted in a 50% decrease in tumor growth. Gil’s group at the Imperial College London studied the effect of rapamycin on oncogene-induced senescence in human fibroblasts [106]. Rapamycin reduced markers of senescence and SASPs secreted by the senescent cells. Subsequently, two other laboratories also reported that rapamycin reduced SASP in senescent cells. Houssaini et al. [107] showed that rapamycin reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from senescent pulmonary vascular endothelial cells from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chen et al. [108] studied senescence in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis using lung epithelial cells treated with bleomycin. Rapamycin suppressed markers of senescence in the bleomycin-treated cells and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In a co-culture system with the bleomycin-treated cells and pulmonary fibroblasts, rapamycin treatment attenuated the proliferation of pulmonary fibroblasts and decreased the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and collagen I in the fibroblasts compared with pulmonary fibroblasts co-cultured with bleomycin-treated cells not treated with rapamycin. Thus, the current data support rapamycin’s ability to reduce SASP expression by senescent cells.\nOf particular interest to this review are the three studies showing that rapamycin suppressed cell senescence in vivo in mice. Castilho et al. [109] studied a genetically engineered mouse (K5rtTA/tet-Wnt) in which Wnt1 is persistently expressed in the epithelial compartment of the skin. These mice show a rapid growth of hair follicles that is then followed by a disappearance of the epidermal stem cell compartment, progressive premature hair loss, and epithelial stem cell senescence. Treating the mice with rapamycin (4 mg/kg, i.p. for 18 days) prevented the accumulation of senescent epithelial stem cells, which in turn prevented long-term Wnt1-induced hair loss in the K5rtTA/tet-Wnt mice. Hinojosa et al. [110] studied the effect of rapamycin (4.7, 14, and 42 ppm) on p21 expression in the lungs of old (22 months) UM-HET3 mice. Cell senescence was reduced by all three doses of rapamycin. Herranz et al. [106] studied the effect of rapamycin on the paracrine effects of senescent cells on the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells using a mouse model of oncogene-induced senescence, NrasG12V mice. NrasG12V expression induced senescence in liver, and the SASPs produced by the senescent cells trigger an immune response in these mice. Rapamycin treatment (1 mg/kg by gavage once every 3 days) reduced SASP production in the NrasG12V mice. In studying the effect of rapamycin on various aspects of cardiac function in old mice, Lesniewski et al. [111] found that rapamycin treatment (14 ppm) for 6 to 8 weeks reversed the age-related increase in the senescence marker, p19, in the aorta of old (~ 30 months) male B6D2F1 mice. Chen et al. [108] studied the role of cell senescence in pulmonary fibrosis using mice treated with bleomycin (intratracheally). Rapamycin (5 mg/kg, i.e., every other day a week after bleomycin treatment) was found to suppress the expression of senescence markers that were induced by bleomycin treatment. In addition, the rapamycin-treated mice showed reduced collagen deposition and pathological lesions in the lungs of the bleomycin-treated mice. A study with human subject > 40 years of age by Chung et al. [112] showed that the topical rapamycin reduced cellular senescence (p16INK4A expression) in the skin that was accompanied by an improvement in the clinical appearance of the skin.\nSummary\nIn the 10 years since the initial report that rapamycin increased the lifespan of mice, there has been an explosion in the number of reports studying the effect of rapamycin on various parameters related to aging in mice. These studies have focused on determining the overall impact of rapamycin on aging processes and identifying potential mechanisms responsible for rapamycin’s pro-longevity effect. As a result of the data generated, it is now clear that there is a consensus in many areas as to the impact of rapamycin on mice, and the research reports in these areas have been described in this review. The first and most important outcome of these studies has been the demonstration that rapamycin has a robust effect on the lifespan of mice. Thirty studies have been conducted since 2009 showing rapamycin increases the lifespan of various strains and genetic models of mice (Tables 1 and 2). Currently, there are only three genetic mouse models where rapamycin has been reported to decrease the lifespan of the mice, i.e., ~ 90% of the reports that have studied the effect of rapamycin on lifespan in mice have shown a significant increase. One of the unexpected results from the lifespan studies is that rapamycin is effective over a broad range of doses in mice; doses much higher (threefold to 10-fold) than that initially shown to increase lifespan (14 ppm), i.e., rapamycin toxicity does not appear to be problematic in mice. Unfortunately, most of the reports studying the effect of rapamycin in mice have used only the lower, 14 ppm, dose of rapamycin. Based on the lifespan data, one might expect greater differences in the parameters that have been studied when higher doses of rapamycin are used.\nWhen rapamycin was shown to increase the lifespan of mice, one of the first questions raised was whether this increase was due to rapamycin’s effect on aging. One of the ways to approach this question is to determine if rapamycin has a broad effect on processes directly related to aging, e.g., incidence of diseases. In other words, does rapamycin reduce/delay age-related diseases as well as increase lifespan? As shown in this review, the large amount of data in mice shows that rapamycin has a major impact on cancer, cardiac diseases and function, and normal brain aging including brain vascular aging and neurodegenerative-like processes in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, rapamycin attenuates cell senescence in a broad range of cell types. Thus, rapamycin appears to have an anti-aging impact on a large number of disease-related processes in mice. Consequently, rapamycin is the first drug shown to have anti-aging actions in a mammal.\nOne of the intriguing aspects of rapamycin’s actions is that it is effective when given in later life. In the initial study by Harrison et al. [6], it was shown that rapamycin increased lifespan when administered to 19-month-old mice. Interestingly, the current data show that rapamycin is as effective increasing lifespan late in life as when it is given earlier in life. Additional studies not only show that rapamycin can be effective later in life but also that the effect of rapamycin can persist after treatment [113], i.e., mice do not have to be continuously treated with rapamycin for it to have an effect. For example, Bitto et al. [20] showed that treating 20-month-old mice with a high dose or rapamycin for only 3 months resulted in a dramatic increase in lifespan. In addition, they found that changes in the microbiome induced by rapamycin in these mice persisted after rapamycin treatment was discontinued. Several other investigators have shown that late life rapamycin treatment can reverse some age-related deficits in several physiological functions. For example, 10 to 12 weeks of rapamycin treatment reversed the age-related decline in cardiac function in 24- to 25-month-old mice [58, 59], and the improvement in cardiac function persisted for 2 months after rapamycin treatment was discontinued [113]. Lesniewski et al. [111] showed that 6 to 8 weeks of rapamycin reversed the age-related vascular dysfunction in 30-month-old mice. The age-related decline in cognition was also reversed when old (~ 20 months) mice were treated with rapamycin for 6 to 16 weeks [77, 79]. From a translational stand-point, these data are exciting because it suggests that rapamycin not only can reverse many of the adverse aspects of aging late in life but also need not be continuously given; its effect might persist well after it is discontinued. This also has recently been observed in elderly human subjects. In a study where 264 elderly subjects were given the rapalog, RAD001 for 6 weeks, Mannick et al. [97] found that the antibody titers to influenza virus vaccine were significantly higher in the rapamycin-treated subjects a year after giving rapamycin and the infection rates over the year were significantly reduced.\nConclusion—where do we go from here?\nThe current mouse data conclusively demonstrate that rapamycin is effective in preventing/reversing a broad range of age-related conditions, including lifespan with minimal adverse effects or toxicity. However, there is always a concern as to how well discoveries in mice translate to humans. Currently, there are ongoing studies on the effect of rapamycin on companion dogs (by Matt Kaeberlein and Daniel Promislow at the University of Washington) and the non-human primate, the common marmoset (by Adam Salmon at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio). Salmon’s group recently reported that 9 months of rapamycin treatment had minor effects on clinical laboratory markers (e.g., plasma levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein did not change significantly) in middle-aged male or female marmosets [114]. Therefore, we are at a point when the aging community should began seriously considering clinical trials to test the anti-aging properties of rapamycin in humans as has been argued by Kaeberlein and Galvan [115] and Blagosklonny [87]. A major advantage of taking rapamycin to the clinic is the large amount of data gathered over the past two decades on the effect of rapamycin and its rapalogs on humans. The side effects of rapamycin in humans are well established, e.g., ulcers of mouth and lips, hyperglycemia/diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia [116–118, 123]. In addition, the toxicity profile of rapamycin is relatively low in humans [119]. In addition, rapamycin is approved by the FDA for use in humans for transplantation and pancreatic cancer. Monica Mita (Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles), who has studied extensively the use of rapamycin and rapalogs in cancer therapy, has concluded, “we all have seen patients benefiting from the treatment with rapalogs and doing remarkably well for prolonged time with almost no change in the quality of life” [120]. In the past 2 years, two groups have specifically tested the feasibility of giving rapamycin to older subjects. As noted above, Mannick et al. [97] found that the rapalog, RAD001, was safe when given to subjects ≥ 65 years of age for 6 weeks; the RAD001-treated group actually showed improved response to influenza vaccination and reduced infections. In a pilot study with subjects 70 to 95 years of age who were otherwise healthy, Kraig et al. [121] found that 8 weeks of rapamycin was safely tolerated, e.g., the ",

An update\nZelton Dave Sharp\nRandy Strong\nCorresponding authors: sharp @uthsdcsa.edu and strong@uthscsa.edu\nIssue date 2023 Jun 1.\nIntroduction\nPrior to 2009 the consensus of scholars was that aging could not be treated or if it could be it must be a youth factor (e.g., growth hormone). Numerous advertised ascientific approaches that absconded with a lot of folk’s money mostly confused people and was counterproductive for the field. However, there were two scientific settings in which aging could be reproducibly delayed. Unfortunately, neither were optimal for use in people. They were restrictions of diet and/or growth factors by genetic means. Since people do not like restricting anything, especially food, progress toward a deeper understanding of aging and potential ways to delay its effects was slow.\nIn recognition of this bottleneck, the National Institute of Aging did a smart thing. It established a program to identify compounds that could be tested for aging effects under rigorous and standard conditions. The goal was to determine drug effects on life span of genetically heterogeneous mice of both sexes. A major advantage of this new Intervention Testing Program is that the three test sites are geographically separated, the test mice are by design genetically heterogenous and included both sexes and importantly, the site directors are recognized experts in aging studies in rodents but had no stake in the outcomes.\nIt has been exceptionally successful. To date, the ITP website indicates they have tested or in the process of testing 64 different compounds, some at varied doses and in combination. Twenty publications from the ITP have reported increases in life span from ten compounds. Importantly, the ITP also reports compounds that do not extend life span.\nIn section 6 of this special issue, we focus of the ITP 2009 test of what was then an unlikely candidate drug called rapamycin. Results showing increased median and maximum life span in advanced aged males and females in this paper reset the paradigm for aging studies. It suggested that pharmacological agents can prevent, delay and/or reduced the severity of age-caused morbidities. In this section, we will first briefly remind readers about the biology of the cell systems affected by rapamycin, better known as the targets of rapamycin or TOR. Next, we will review the results of several studies on the effects chronic rapamycin has on lifespan in both sexes including our recollection of the that first study (Harrison et al., 2009). Following that, we will relate selected examples of the effects chronic rapamycin has on age-caused diseases. We conclude with our view of what rapamycin effects are telling us about aging and how it might be working. We confess at the outset that we have only a faint picture of rapamycin’s function as an anti-aging agent and suggest that it will be as complicated and mysterious as the studies to determine how restriction of food and growth factors work, which after half a century still have a way to go.\nTOR Story\nThe discovery of rapamycin, its characterization and development have been covered previously (Sharp and Strong, 2010). The discovery of its intracellular receptor FKBP (a proline rotomase) was concomitant with the genetic identification of the target of rapamycin TOR1 and TOR2 in yeast (Heitman et al., 1991). The big question then was what do these genes encode? When obtained the cDNAs for yeast TOR1 and TOR2 turned out to look like large novel kinases, which at first were thought to regulate the cell cycle. However, in a now classic paper and one we feel set the stage for TOR’s role in aging, Barbet et al. (Barbet et al., 1996) showed that inactivation of TOR either by rapamycin or deletion led to a starved phenotype and G1 arrest. After identification of TOR in budding yeast, multiple labs reported the identification of one gene encoding mammalian target of rapamycin (Brown et al., 1994; Chiu et al., 1994; Sabatini et al., 1994). Each lab named it differently but eventually got merged into mammalian TOR (mTOR), then mechanistic TOR followed, with some reservations (Hall, 2013). Thus, it was these discoveries that led one of us (zds) to envision chronic rapamycin as a potential antiaging compound that would mimic diet restriction. However, there was another clue that centered on the issue of cell and organism size that also played a big role in the thinking.\nAlthough it’s hard to imagine, the prevailing view up to that time was that cells and organisms somehow just naturally grew given sufficient nutrients. How cell size was determined was unknown. In the aging world, thoughtful investigations of ideas about organism size indicated that mass is somehow involved in life span determination. Small dogs live healthier. longer lives than big dogs. But just how this worked was pretty much a mystery.\nAt that time, there were two interventions known to extend life span: diet restriction and pituitary dwarfs. One of us (zds) wondered about a common phenotype that linked both interventions, which was that they both resulted in smaller animals compared to controls. How could size play a role in age retardation? Multiple factors regulate body size, two being either fewer cells or smaller cells. For the long-lived Snell pituitary dwarf (Flurkey et al., 2001), they have the same number of skeletal muscle fibers (cells) as wild type, but the fiber size is significantly smaller (Stickland et al., 1994). This suggested that pituitary dwarfs lacking in growth hormone (plus TSH and prolactin) could result from reduced mTOR activity which was shown in liver and muscle by one of us (zds) in collaboration with Andrzej Bartke (Sharp and Bartke, 2005). Thus, reduced mTOR due to growth factor (or factors) restriction in mice and by diet restriction or rapamycin in yeast were both linked to aging. Could chronic rapamycin mimic both processes to slow aging?\nIt was a crazy idea. The main objection then and now is that rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant in people and is, therefore a dangerous drug for chronic use in humans, especially in elders. Rapamycin was and still is used (in various formulations and combinations) for cancer treatment, and chronically as an agent to suppress rejection of transplants. Interestingly in this last group of patients, the incidence of cancer is reduced (Knoll et al., 2014; Salgo et al., 2010). Despite the black label warning on sirolimus, the ITP agreed to test it. Now it was up to us, to make this test happen.\nThe Test\nIt was not smooth sailing at first. We were aiming for rapamycin blood concentrations like those in transplant patients (10 ng/ml). Although rapamycin in food had the expected reduction of mTOR activity in visceral adipose, the drug degraded too fast for use in an ITP trial. Fortunately, one of us (rs) recognized that we needed a method to stabilize rapamycin in food for storage and use if we were ever going to complete the first experiment. In consultation with Dr. X at the Southwest Research Institute, encapsulation with an excipient called Eudragit S100 was recommend for this purpose. This formulation releases rapamycin at close to a neural pH, which is found in distal small intestine and colon in rodents. To our delight, blood levels exceed expectations for our 14 ppm diet (Nadon et al., 2008), and the three sites of the ITP began the trial with this diet on the first cohorts of mice at all three sites. Because of the time it took to develop encapsulated rapamycin (now called eRapa), the cohorts in the three test sites had aged to 20 months. There was a real concern that these older mice could not tolerate our ITP rapamycin diets but it turned out to be not true.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the results published of this first experiment reported in Nature (Harrison et al., 2009), showed median and maximum life span extension in both sexes. It was remarkable, especially such a response in older mice that were expected to die from treatment. Since this paper, the ITP has performed 5 trials (one in progress), all with the same results; mice live longer and healthier on this drug. One of the more remarkable results showed a dose response, with females showing the greatest benefit (Miller et al., 2014). The question is however, will it perform this well in people? We will return to this question in a bit, but it seemed that this would be a good point to briefly review what’s known about its target, TOR.\nTwo complexes assemble that both contain mTOR. mTORC1 and mTORC2 each promote autonomous cell and non-autonomous cell-specific functions. mTORC1 initially was the main focus of aging research with many studies indicating that it is a key regulator of gaining and age-caused diseases (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). When nutrients and growth factors are replete, mTORC1 promotes anabolic pathways for cell mass accumulation. When opposite conditions are prevalent, it promotes catabolic processes for survival of cells.\nAs shown in Figure 2, there are activating factors for mTORC1 and stresses that cells encounter that repress mTORC1 both of which that lead to activation of its downstream effectors that function in aging and cancer. Figure 2 is highly simplified, and there are excellent reviews that provide detailed discussions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 structure, function and signaling networks (Bar-Peled and Sabatini, 2014; Betz and Hall, 2013; Cornu et al., 2013; Dibble and Manning, 2013; Huang and Fingar, 2014; Jewell and Guan, 2013; Laplante and Sabatini, 2012; Ochocki and Simon, 2013; Rexin et al., 2015). Lamming et al.(Lamming et al., 2014) proposed that active mTORC1 represses longevity, while a functioning mTORC2 promotes longevity in males.\n\nGeneralized model of rapamycin effects on aging through inhibition of mTORC1.\nmTORC2 is not considered in this model. mTORC1 responds to various activation signals (nutrients, growth factors, etc. and to inhibitory signals (stresses such as genotoxic, oxidative, etc.). Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin inhibits normal aging and associated diseases by currently unknown mechanisms. Aylett(Aylett et al., 2016) et al. found a structural change where by the TOR signaling motif (TOS) in raptor was displaced thereby limiting access of the kinase active site (asterisk) to TOS-containing substrates such as S6 kinase 1 (right schematic).\nHow does rapamycin work?\nIn structure and function, the mTOR genes discussed earlier are conserved in eukaryotes, including plants (John et al., 2011). The protein belongs to a larger family of what has been referred to “ ‘giant’ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–like protein kinases (PIKKs)” (Smerdon, 2014). The conserved structure function domains of this family and the one specific for mTOR are shown linearly in Figure 1. Aylett et al.(Aylett et al., 2016) identified the horn and bridge areas of the heat-repeat-containing N-terminal domain, which is common to other members of the PIKK family as are the FAT, FAT-C and kinase domains (Smerdon, 2014). The unusual (and defining) feature of mTOR is the FRB region located on the N-terminus of the kinase domain, with which the FKBP12-rapamycin complex interacts. Evidently, the FRB domain evolved, at least in part, to interact with phosphatidic acid (PA) thereby stabilizing and activating one of the complexes containing mTOR (mTORC1), reviewed by Foster(Foster, 2013)). Rapamycin-FKBP12 competes with PA for mTOR binding. PA also stabilizes the other mTOR complex (mTORC2), which is less sensitive to acute rapamycin-FKBP12 competition. But, what are the effects on diseases and aging?\n\nSchematic of mTOR structure. Indicated are identified domains. The kinase domain is located near the C-terminus following an N-terminal helical repeat motifs (HEAT repeats), which are subdivided into a curved solenoid (called the horn and straight solenoid referred to as the bridge(Aylett et al., 2016). Another (tetratricopeptide (TPR) (Knutson, 2010) repeat-containing domain named FAT (Frap, ATM and TRRAP). A C-terminal FAT domain (FAT-C) is structurally different from the FAT domain, but was also named after Frap, ATM, TRRAP. The N-terminus of the kinase domain is the defining region of the protein known as theFK506 binding protein (FKBP)-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain, which is necessary for rapamycin allosteric inhibition of mTOR. Acting independently of the FRB domain are ATP-competitive inhibitors.\nEffects of chronic rapamycin on age-associated diseases.\nIn response to these results, labs worldwide began testing eRapa and other formulations on various types of age-associated diseases. A common question studied by the ITP and others was: does eRapa delay signs of aging? For example, starting eRapa at 9 months of age slows aging traits in UM-HET3 mice, although noting a higher incidence of testicular degeneration (Wilkinson et al., 2012). In an inbred strain, C57BL/6, starting the diet at 19 months of age, Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2014) investigated this question and concluded eRapa extended life and health span, with no differences noted in testicular degeneration or cataracts in older mice(. In a follow up study of long-term effects of chronic eRapa starting at 4 months of age and continued to the end of life, Fischer et al. (Fischer et al., 2015) data indicated that lifespan and health span are not necessarily correlated. In another study by Neff et al. (Neff et al., 2013) eRapa extended life span but improved only a few of a wide range of age-associated phenotypes. In addition, the treated mince exhibited two adverse events: testicular degeneration and nephrotoxicity. Ehninger et al. (Ehninger et al., 2014) proposed that chronic eRapa does not slow aging but suppresses cancer, the major cause of mortality in mice. In a rebuttal to this paper Johnson et al.(Johnson et al., 2013a) stated results “supports the model that rapamycin promotes longevity by targeting some, but perhaps not all, core molecular processes that drive cellular and systemic aging.” A very large field of study quickly grew. Since the ITP’s 2009 paper, a weekly search from the NCBI titled “What’s new for mTOR” report of new papers ranges from 50 to 100 per week. Most of these papers are disease oriented showing mTOR involvement (mostly up regulated). The concept of mTOR-opathies has emerged.\nIn a book section written in 2016 (Sharp, 2017), a table listed selected diseases related to aging in which rapamycin and its sister formulations had been used. Today such a table would take up too much space due to a substantial increase. For example, in cancer alone the number of papers returned by PubMed search using rapamycin or sirolimus, cancer article published since 2016 returned over 260 papers. The same increases were seen in other categories such as neuro degenerative diseases. One that is noteworthy for this review in the cancer section is from Brown’s group at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, reported for the first time that a rapalog, everolimus showed promise as a breast cancer prevention agent (Mazumdar et al., 2022) This is significant since most agents for cancer are for treatments (and rightly so), but one for prevention is that is also works as an antiaging agent is momentous.\nThis is in line with the cancer prevention preclinical studies conducted by our group in several murine models of cancer. In these studies we treated then with our enteric formulation of rapamycin we call eRapa. In a previous study of diet restriction in the Rb1+/− neuroendocrine tumorigenic model, we showed that this intervention had only a minimal effect on life span and tumor prevention (Sharp et al., 2003). In contrast, chromic eRapa treatment showed a highly significant extension of life span and delay of tumor development in both sexes (Livi et al., 2013). This is an interesting difference in the in vivo response to diet restriction versus mTORC1 inhibition. The next model was another one with an altered tumor suppressor gene p53 including +/+, +/− and −/− genotypes. We found that p53 and rapamycin are additive in life span effects (Christy et al., 2015).\nTo round out our work on murine tumor suppressor models that spontaneously generate cancer we chose ApcMin/+ mice that are heterozygous for the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc), which is a model for familial adenomatous polyposis or FAP. In humans, APC inhibits pro-growth WNT signaling through the regulation of β-catenin transport to the nucleus. APC mutations results in the development of numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps at a young age. The polyps inevitably progress to colorectal cancer if left untreated. The standard of care is total colectomy, which is a morbid and life altering treatment.\nIn collaboration with Paul Hasty, we tested the postulate that enterically delivered rapamycin by eRapa in ApcMin/+ mice would intervene in the tumorigenic processes in the small intestine crypts to extend life span. The results were impressive with some treated animals outliving wildtype female mice (Hasty et al., 2014). We repeated this experiment in both males and females and found the observed the same results, except that in this experiment males lived longer than females (Parihar et al., 2020). To determine if eRapa was effective in preventing malignant tumors in this model, we pretreated with eRapa followed by dextran sodium sulfate treatments. This setting converts ApcMin/+ mice from a polyposis small intestine model to a colorectal cancer model. Again, eRapa prevented tumors in this model and extended life span equally in both sexes (Parihar et al., 2021). This work set the stage for testing eRapa in humans.\nBased on ours and other’s work with eRapa the following clinical trials are underway.\nAs mentioned, mTORC1 has been a focus in aging. A recent exciting paper by Frei et al.(Frei et al., 2022) shows that mTOC2 is likely to have a big role also. The study focused on thet sympathetic and possibly sensory communication of the central nervous system with white adipose tissue (WAT). This elegant study reported that adipose mTORC2, (a major component of the insulin signaling) is necessary for arborization of sensory neurons in WAT. A bigger point is that this work suggests WAT may affect systemic energy homeostasis via this sensory network. WAT is also one of the most responsive tissues to rapamycin, which showed an opposite adaptation to other tissues such as colon (Dodds et al., 2016).\nWhen rapamycin was not good.\nWhile most outcomes to chronic rapamycin are anti-aging, the results in one experiment is noteworthy for its opposite effect and relevance to a large patient population in the elderly, type-2 diabetes. Chronic eRapa resulted in an increase in mortality in a mouse model (db/db of this disease due to suppurative inflammation (Sataranatarajan et al., 2015). Another major failure of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin was a trial studying intravitreal sirolimus in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Petrou et al., 2014). This was unexpected since hyperactivated mTORC1 was widely viewed as playing a major role in development and progression of AMD (Zhao et al., 2011)(Zhang et al., 2020)(Huang et al., 2019)(Zigler et al., 2011)(Kaur et al., 2018)(Go et al., 2020). Why an intravitreal approach lead to adverse events is somewhat mysterious since systemic sirolimus cured AMD-like symptoms in a mouse model when administer iP (Zhao et al., 2011). In hyperglycemic rats, an IP injection of rapamycin reduced diabetes -induced VEGF overexpression that controls vascular permeability and angiogenesis (Kida et al., 2021). One wonders if systemic intervention with mTORC1 inhibitors would have better success in prevention or treatment in people. It is also noteworthy that the use of mTOR inhibitors in diseases not associated with aging is increasingly wide spread (summarized in (Johnson et al., 2013b).\nWhere to from here?\nIn a recent review published in Cell, López et al., a paper titled: “Hallmarks of aging: An expanding universe” (López-Otín et al., 2022). They proposed 12 hallmarks of aging and three of health. We submit that chronic rapamycin (and diet restriction) likely mitigates the former and promotes the latter. If true, this bodes well for an extremely exciting future for research deeper into mTOR system in aging and its diseases.\nWe end with our selection for the most interesting question in aging research. It is, will synthetic organism age? This is related to the deeper question, is life possible without aging? More relevant to this article, Figure 4 illustrates our view of the present and future as it relates more specifically to mTOR modulators and the future of aging prevention.\n\nAging, represented by the black box, is one of if not the hardest problems in biology. We do know it causes or at least contributes to a wide variety of late adult stage diseases. Rapamycin has variable effects on these diseases. The left panel shows some that it helps (green arrows) and others it hurts (red arrows). It appears to have both good and (not so) bad effects on the immune system (gold arrow) and might be better termed an immune modulator (Kolosova et al., 2013). This indicates that, while rapamycin might be an effective approach for translational gerontology, each patient will need to be evaluated considering these differential effects. In the right panel, we envision the future where we begin to have a window into the black box of aging and turn all the arrows green, meaning that knowledge of how rapamycin effects aging will lead to new therapies (perhaps combinatorial) which will further improve overall heal span in people. This will also probably coincide with mitigation of the 12 hallmarks of aging proposed by López et al. (López-Otín et al., 2022).\nSupplementary Material\nReferences:\nAssociated Data\nThis section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.\nSupplementary Materials\nACTIONS\nPERMALINK\nRESOURCES\n\n\n                            Similar articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                             Cited by other articles\n                        \n\n\n\n                                 Links to NCBI Databases\n                            \n\nCite\nAdd to Collections\n\n                            Connect with NLM\n                        \n\nNational Library of Medicine\n             8600 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD 20894\n\n",

Concerns over the risk of potentially serious side effects in humans, including immunosuppression and metabolic disruptions, have cautiously limited the translation of rapamycin and its analogs as a treatment for aging associated conditions. During the last decade, we and others have developed a working model that suggests that while inhibition of mTORC1 promotes healthy aging, many of the negative side effects of rapamycin are associated with “off-target” inhibition of a second mTOR complex, mTORC2. Differences in the kinetics and molecular mechanisms by which rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 suggest that a therapeutic window for rapamycin could be exploited using intermittent dosing schedules or alternative rapalogs that may enable more selective inhibition of mTORC1. However, the optimal dosing schedules and the long-term efficacy of such interventions in humans are unknown. Here, we highlight ongoing or upcoming clinical trials that will address outstanding questions regarding the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of rapamycin and rapalogs on several clinically oriented outcomes. Results from these early phase studies will help guide the design of phase 3 clinical trials to determine whether rapamycin can be used safely to inhibit mTORC1 for the treatment and prevention of age-related diseases in humans.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11357-023-00935-x.\nKeywords: Aging, mTOR, Sirolimus, Everolimus, Metabolism, Muscle\nIntroduction\nThe world is experiencing an unprecedented increase in the number of aged individuals [1]. The number of people over the age of 65 is expected to reach 2 billion by the year 2050 [2]. Age is a significant risk factor for most major causes of morbidity and mortality in the USA, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), frailty, and dementia (Fig. 1). The financial impact of caring for elderly individuals is daunting with Medicare expenditures expected to top $1 trillion this year [4]. The high comorbidity of age-related diseases in the elderly individuals limits the benefit that can be obtained by targeting any one chronic condition individually [5]. Therefore, it is important to test geroprotective interventions that have shown efficacy in preclinical models to determine if these agents can simultaneously delay or even prevent multiple age-related conditions in humans.\nFig. 1.\n\nAge is one of the greatest risk factors for nearly every chronic condition. Rapamycin is the most repeatable and effective pharmacological approaches to extend lifespan and delay or treat many age-related pathologies in diverse model systems. A critical translational gap in knowledge is whether rapamycin or rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) can safely maintain or improve healthy aging in humans. CVD, cardiovascular disease; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus; ADRD, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Figure adapted from Kaeberlein et al. [3]\nThe evolutionarily conserved mTOR protein kinase is a key regulator of growth, metabolism, and aging. Genetic inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling extends the lifespan in yeast, worms, flies, and mice [6–9]. mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin is one of the most repeatedly and rigorously tested pharmacological approaches to extend lifespan in diverse model systems and across multiple independent laboratories. In addition to mTORC1 inhibition, rapamycin has significant impact on several proposed biomarkers and fundamental mechanisms of the biology of aging, such as increased markers of autophagy, suppression of the senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), regulation of nuclear transcription factors, selective protein translation, and altering epigenetic patterns in rodents [10–14]. The goal of this review is to (1) briefly showcase how mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) can extend healthspan by maintaining, improving, or restoring select indices of physiological function in pre-clinical and some human studies (Table 1); (2) discuss potential risks and key knowledge gaps regarding the clinical use of rapamycin for geroprotection; and (3) highlight several ongoing or upcoming clinical trials that will begin to test if the benefits of rapamycin in pre-clinical models can be safely translated to humans. It is important to note that this is not an endorsement for or against the use of mTOR inhibitors, but rather a compendium of upcoming clinical trials leveraging the last two decades of pre-clinical data to help advance our understanding of the impact of rapamycin on human healthspan.\n\nTable 1.\nSummary of completed rapamycin clinical trials*\nEverolimus 0.5 mg daily\nEverolimus 5 mg weekly\nEverolimus 20 mg weekly\nPlacebo\nEverolimus 0.1 mg daily\nEverolimus 0.5 mg daily\nBEZ235 10 mg daily\nBEZ235 10 mg+0.1 mg everolimus daily\nPlacebo\nRapamycin 1 mg\nPlacebo\nTopical rapamycin (10 μM)\nTopical placebo\nRTB101 10 mg daily\nPlacebo\n*Studies are presented in chronological order from the publication date. AA, amino acid\nImpact of rapamycin on select physiological outcomes in pre-clinical and clinical studies\nMetabolic function\nThe incidence of metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance, prediabetes, and overt T2D, increases with age and further increases the risk of nearly every age-related condition including heart disease, frailty, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia [23–27]. The nutrient overload model of insulin resistance posits that insulin resistance results, in part, from constitutive activation of mTORC1 leading to S6K1 and Grb10 mediated feedback inhibition on insulin receptor substrate 1/2 (IRS-1/2) [28–30]. Consistent with this model, (1) mice lacking S6K1, a downstream target of mTOR, are protected from age and diet-induced insulin resistance [29, 31] and (2) rapamycin given intermittently or at a low dose improves metabolic health and insulin sensitivity in mouse models of obesity [32–34]. In healthy young men, a single dose of rapamycin (6 mg) attenuated mTORC1 during an amino acid infusion and increased peripheral insulin sensitivity by nearly 20% [15]. Conversely, long-term treatment with rapamycin doses ≥2 mg/kg/day in mice disrupts a second mTOR complex (mTORC2) and leads to insulin resistance [7, 35, 36] as evident by increased fasting insulin (104 vs. 86 pmol/L), elevated basal endogenous glucose production (EGP: 30.4 vs. 16.1 mg/kg/min), impaired suppression of EGP during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (39% vs. 67%), and glucose intolerance (39711 vs. 23075 AUC) in rapamycin treated versus vehicle controls [7]. We have also shown that hyperglycemia induced by 12 weeks of dietary rapamycin (14ppm) was correlated with greater osteoarthritis severity in guinea pigs prone to idiopathic osteoarthritis [37] suggesting that metabolic disruptions by long-term daily rapamycin may exacerbate some geriatric conditions in animal models.\nCognitive function\nDecreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) occurs during normal aging and deficits in CBF are worsened by vascular risk factors like impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance [24, 38, 39]. The decline in CBF that accompanies age and insulin resistance is associated with memory dysfunction before the development of overt diseases like T2D and Alzheimer’s [24, 25]. Therefore, therapies that can slow the biological rate of aging and age-related conditions may provide an effective strategy to mitigate the age-related risk of dementia. Rapamycin can cross the blood-brain barrier and mTOR attenuation by rapamycin prevents and reverses cognitive and cerebrovascular dysfunction in multiple models of Alzheimer’s disease as well as high-fat diet–induced vascular cognitive impairment [40–42]. In C57BL/6 mice, dietary rapamycin (14ppm) enhances cognitive function by ~25–100%, depending on the outcome, in young adult mice and blocks age-associated cognitive decline in older mice (12 and 25 months old) [40]. Additionally, 15 months of dietary rapamycin (14ppm) improves spatial learning and memory in 34-month-old F344BNF1 rats by ~50% [43]. In aging animals, improvements in cognitive performance by mTOR inhibition are linked to restoring cerebrovascular blood flow to adult animals [43].\nCardiac function\nWith age, there is an increase in cardiac stiffness and a decrease in ventricular volume that are associated with increased risk for heart failure and CVD [44]. Rapamycin reverses pre-existing age-dependent cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in mice [45, 46] and the effects of rapamycin on diastolic function, hypertrophy, and myocardial stiffness persist even following cessation of treatment [47]. Similarly, 10 weeks of rapamycin treatment (0.05–0.1 mg/kg 3×/week) increased diastolic and systolic cardiac function compared to placebo in a small cohort of dogs, with the greatest improvements in those dogs with lowest baseline scores [48].\nPhysical function\nSkeletal muscle health and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) play a critical role in maintaining mobility, whole-body metabolism, and survival [49–53]. Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and CRF increase the risk of disability, loss of independence, and mortality [53–56]. Higher skeletal muscle function and CRF are associated with protection from multi-morbidity and mortality [57–60]. In animal models and humans, there is evidence of an age-related increase in skeletal muscle mTOR signaling [61–67] and an impaired muscle protein synthetic response to acute anabolic stimuli [68]. Genetic activation of mTORC1 by knockout of the upstream inhibitor TSC1 contributes to muscle loss [69, 70]. Correcting hyperactive skeletal muscle mTORC1 signaling in aged rats by low-dose treatment with the rapalog everolimus (equivalent to 0.5 mg/day in humans) and dietary rapamycin in old mice partially or completely prevents age-related muscle atrophy [61, 65]. Furthermore, 3 months of high-dose dietary rapamycin (126ppm) slowed the age-related decline in physical function in older mice as evident by greater forelimb grip strength and longer rotarod run time in rapamycin treated versus control mice even 3 months after stopping treatment [71]. These findings, like that of cardiac function, suggest that the benefits on physical function in older mice may persist even after ending rapamycin treatment. However, a single dose of rapamycin (12 or 16 mg) attenuated the acute increase in muscle protein synthesis rates after resistance exercise in young men [16, 17], which is one process involved in muscle growth. Therefore, it remains unclear if attenuation of mTOR signaling by rapamycin with or without exercise may positively or negatively impact skeletal muscle and physical function in older adults.\nImmune function\nOlder adults are characterized by a decline in immune function that contributes to lower vaccine efficacy and increased vulnerability to infection. Age-related loss of immune function contributes to mortality linked to influenza and COVID-19 which disproportionately affects older persons. Just 6 weeks of treating older mice with rapamycin restored immune cell function and improved response to the influenza vaccine [72]. In older humans, a 6-week treatment with daily (0.5 mg/day) or intermittent (5 mg/week) everolimus rejuvenated aspects of the immune system and boosted the subsequent response to the influenza vaccination by >1.25-fold against two of three strains tested without metabolic side effects [18]. However, a higher weekly dose (20 mg/week) did not meet primary endpoints of increasing the serologic response to the influenza vaccine and led to more than double the number of adverse events compared to placebo and lower everolimus doses. While phase 2b and 3 clinical trials also showed that mTOR inhibitors increased antiviral gene expression in older patients, primary endpoints of decreasing laboratory confirmed or clinically symptomatic respiratory illness were not met [22]. The discrepancies between studies of meeting or not meeting primary endpoints are likely related to the pre-specified primary outcome. Although mTOR inhibitors appear to generally have a positive impact on immune function in older adults, additional work is needed to clarify the role of mTORC1 inhibition on immune function and vaccine efficacy in older adults.\nPotential risks and unknowns\nDespite the positive effects on lifespan and many indices of healthspan, mTOR inhibitor–based therapies for diseases of aging have not yet translated to clinical practice, largely due to a small number of human trials and potential safety concerns. Consistent with many animals studies, chronic treatment with rapamycin or rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) at the FDA-approved immunosuppressive doses (i.e., rapamycin 2–5 mg per day; everolimus up to 10 mg/day) to prevent organ transplant rejection or to treat some cancers are associated with deleterious metabolic consequences, including glucose intolerance (22% of patients), dyslipidemia (30–72% of patients), and an increased risk of developing new-onset diabetes (hazard ratio: 1.36 to 1.9) [73–78]. Furthermore, in a small study of healthy older adults, 8 weeks of daily rapamycin (1mg/day) tended to increase HbA1c, triglycerides, and VLDL [20] which challenges whether this represents an appropriate long-term dosing regimen. While these adverse side effects may be acceptable to patient populations, alternative dosing schedules are likely needed to minimize these adverse effects in older adults to achieve an acceptable risk to benefit ratio for geroprotection.\nEven with the potential risks, unknown impact, and limited testing in humans, recent estimates suggest over 2000 people across the USA are currently taking rapamycin off label. Additionally, telemedicine services are beginning to launch that will increase accessibility to rapamycin. A recent observational study compared rapamycin users (n=333) to non-rapamycin users (n=172) [79]. Most users followed a weekly rapamycin dosing schedule, across a range of doses, for the purpose of “healthy longevity/anti-aging.” Mouth ulceration was the only self-reported adverse event (AE) that was greater in rapamycin vs. non-rapamycin users [79]. Interestingly, 50% of rapamycin users agreed that rapamycin improved their health while ~25–38% of rapamycin users felt younger, more confident, more energetic, and/or helped with other perceived health benefits. However, the remaining ~62–75% of rapamycin users did not perceive that rapamycin improved these domains [79]. Although difficult to assess without a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study design, rapamycin users did report less abdominal cramps and pain, signs of depression, muscle tightness, anxiety, and eye pain. No clinical laboratory results were evaluated to determine any potential differences in health between rapamycin versus non-rapamycin users.\nWorking model\nThe mTOR kinase is the catalytic core of mTORC1 and mTORC2, each of which is composed of shared as well as unique protein subunits (Fig. 2), and which phosphorylate different substrates to regulate different metabolic processes. One of the major differences between mTORC1 and mTORC2 is that rapamycin acutely inhibits mTORC1 while chronic treatment with rapamycin also inhibits mTORC2 signaling in cultured cells and in mice [7, 80, 81]. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 by first forming a complex with FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) which then binds to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain of mTOR located on the surface of mTORC1 [82–84]. mTORC2 is not acutely sensitive to rapamycin because components of mTORC2, specifically Rictor and mSin1, hinder the binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to mTOR [85–87]. When high doses of rapamycin treatment are continued for a prolonged period of time, mTORC2 activity is decreased in most mouse tissues [7, 80, 81, 88] and this effect of rapamycin on mTORC2 is believed to be indirect, with rapamycin sequestering free mTOR and hindering the formation of new mTORC2 [80].\nFig. 2.\n\nRapamycin acutely and potently inhibits mTORC1 while prolonged exposure to high, daily doses of rapamycin can lead to off-target inhibition of mTORC2. We propose to test the model that inhibition of mTORC1 is geroprotective, while inhibition of mTORC2 mediates metabolic side effects of rapamycin. Rapalog strategies that safely exploit the potent geroprotective effects of mTORC1 inhibition may warrant further testing for the treatment and prevention of age-related diseases in larger phase 3 clinical trials\nUsing genetic models, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling alone extends lifespan and healthspan [7, 8] while tissue-specific and whole body genetic depletion of mTORC2 has negative effects on metabolic health, frailty, and survival in mice [89–93]. Similarly, genetic inhibition of mTORC2 activity in the heart impairs cardiac function in flies, while genetically increasing mTORC2 activity preserves cardiac function with aging and extends the lifespan of flies [94, 95]. These data support a model shown in Fig. 2 in which rapalog-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 is geroprotective, while the “off-target” inhibition of mTORC2 may be responsible for many negative effects of rapamycin. Therefore, to enhance translation of mTOR inhibitor-based therapies from pre-clinical models to human clinical trials and clinical practice, rapalog dosing strategies that preferentially inhibit mTORC1 rather than mTORC2 should be tested to potentially capitalize on healthspan extension while minimizing adverse side effects.\nCollectively, these data indicate an urgent need to build on the exciting pre-clinical and clinical work that has already been completed to determine if rapamycin and rapalogs can be used safely and efficaciously for geroprotection in humans. There is currently a lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data in healthy older adults. Therefore, it remains unknown what dose or dosing schedule of rapamycin or rapalogs minimizes undesirable side effects in older adults and whether rapamycin can have a beneficial impact on proposed biomarkers of aging and human healthspan as it does in pre-clinical models. We also do not understand if the dose of rapamycin for geroprotection will differ between sex, the age-related condition(s), or impacted tissue(s). Furthermore, we do not know how rapamycin will interact with healthy lifestyle practices such as exercise and diet. To address this need for additional information, a number of new clinical trials at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and around the world have begun or will begin in the near future to better study the effects of rapamycin and its analogs on age-related conditions (Table 2). The studies that are summarized within this review were identified by using search criteria rapamycin and mTOR on clinicaltrials.gov and through recent funding announcements. Studies were not included that focused on transplant or cancer patients. These relatively small trials will be signal-generating and will be used to inform on future, well-powered phase 3 clinical trials that will be needed for more definitive assessments of the therapeutic potential of rapalogs for human aging-related conditions.\n\nTable 2.\nSummary of ongoing or upcoming rapamycin clinical trials*\nRAP PROTECT\nCommunication with Dr. Dudley Lamming\nRapamycin 16 mg, single dose\nPlacebo\nRTB101 10 mg daily\nPlacebo\nNCT04409327\nCommunication with Dr. Joan Mannick\nRapamycin 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly\nEverolimus 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly\nActive,\nNot yet recruiting\nRAP PAC\nNCT05949658\nDr. Adam Konopka\nRapamycin 5 mg weekly\nPlacebo\nRapamycin 5 mg weekly\nPlacebo\nVIBRANT\nNCT05836025\nCommunication with Drs.

This study is actively recruiting approximately 100 subjects taking or planning to take rapamycin or rapamycin analogs from across the contiguous United States to examine how clinical labs, the blood/plasma transcriptome, metabolome, and lipidome, and the blood methylation clock compare in rapamycin users vs. matched control subjects. The primary outcome of this cross-sectional trial is that rapamycin users will have a lower HOMA-IR than controls. While these data will expand on the insight from a recent observational study [79], there may be some difficulties in interpreting the data in the absence of longitudinal data from each subject, blood samples prior to rapamycin initiation, and double-blinded placebo-control as well as the diverse dosing regimens. Despite these limitations, this cross-sectional comparison will begin to reveal if there are differences in rapamycin users versus non-users in clinical laboratory results as well as molecular and metabolic signatures associated with aging. Therefore, this study may be informative to the geroscience community and those interested in potentially enrolling in one of the physician-supervised clinical trials described within this review.\nThe Rapalog Pharmacology (RAP PAC) Trial led by Dr. Adam Konopka and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will identify a recommended phase 2 weekly dose (RP2D) for the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and everolimus by performing a phase I, dose finding trial in healthy older men and women (n=18 per drug per sex, 55–80years). For each mTOR inhibitor, we propose to test up to 3 weekly dose levels (5, 10, 15 mg/week) for 6 weeks. RAP PAC will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and mTORC1/2 inhibition. The occurrence of dose limited toxicities (DLTs), defined as ≥grade 2 AE using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), will serve as the primary endpoint. We will determine AEs by using a 20-point questionnaire to query about common mTOR inhibitor AEs, review participant diaries, perform clinical bloodwork, and if needed, complete a physical exam. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include investigating the impact of mTOR inhibitors on whole-body glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity via a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 7–10 days of continuous glucose monitoring before and at the end of the 6-week treatment. mTOR signaling will be determined by conventional immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation as well as novel approaches to identify a molecular signature that distinguishes mTORC1 versus mTORC1/2 signaling by integrating transcriptomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. Therefore, this study will combine comprehensive molecular, pharmacologic, and metabolic approaches to evaluate PK/PD in humans and identify dosing regimens that safely inhibit mTORC1 and intervene on the biology and metabolism of aging. A detailed review of the clinical trial protocol and experimental design can be found in the Supplement.\nThe Everolimus Aging Study (EVERLAST) led by Dr. Adam Konopka and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is an ongoing phase 2 trial of 72 insulin-resistant, older adults (55–80 years old) who are at increased risk of multiple aged-related conditions, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, frailty, and dementia [23, 24, 96]. In this randomized, double-blinded study, subjects will receive either 0.5 mg/day everolimus, 5 mg/week everolimus, or placebo-control for approximately 24 weeks. Everolimus tablets and placebo will be over-encapsulated to be indistinguishable from each other. To determine if everolimus can change molecular and physiological aging toward that of young healthy individuals, an additional group of 14 subjects between 18 and 35 years of age will serve as a young healthy reference group to complete baseline testing only (no intervention). The primary endpoint is the change in peripheral insulin sensitivity determined using a dual isotope oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Safety and incidence of treatment-associated adverse events will be determined from participant diaries, questionnaires, and changes in baseline blood chemistry, cell count, lipids, glucose, and insulin. Secondary and other pre-determined exploratory end points include additional indices of metabolic function (glucose tolerance, glycemic variability, hepatic insulin sensitivity), cognitive function (micro- and macro-vessel cerebral blood flow, learning, memory), cardiac function (fractional shortening, E/A ratio, ejection fraction, etc.), and physical function (VO2max, maximal knee extensor power and strength, body composition). To comprehensively examine the molecular target specificity and the impact on mechanisms of aging by everolimus, EVERLAST will evaluate mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, assess mitochondrial bioenergetics, and perform multi-omics (epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics) in muscle biopsy and/or blood samples. EVERLAST will also explore the role of everolimus on senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), DNA methylation clocks, and other proposed biomarkers of aging in saliva, urine, blood, and/or skeletal muscle. A detailed review of the clinical trial protocol and experimental design can be found in the online Supplement.\nAt this time, one EVERLAST ancillary study application is under review and another ancillary study led by Dr. Alexey Terskikh and colleagues at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute is funded. The funded study will perform microscopic imaging of epigenetic age (miEpiAge) to determine how the epigenetic landscape and heterogeneity in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMBCs) and skeletal muscle biopsy samples correlate to metabolic, cognitive, cardiac, and physical function with or without mTOR inhibition by everolimus. miEpiAge is a novel technique rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level to quantitate change in chromatin landscape. Therefore, this ancillary study will capture patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g., acetylated and methylated histones) and employ automated microscopy and machine learning to determine a multiparametric signature of the cellular state.\nClinical trials of mTOR inhibitors for aging-related conditions in humans\nMetabolism and body composition\nThe mTOR as Mediator of Exercise-induced Insulin Sensitivity Study led by Dr. Jørgen FP Wojtaszewski and colleagues in Denmark will evaluate the role of mTOR signaling on insulin sensitivity and muscle protein synthesis after a single exercise bout. This is a non-randomized, double-blinded, cross-over study where young men (22–35 years old) will perform two identical visits separated by at least 14 days that only differ by subjects taking either oral rapamycin (16 mg) or placebo 2 h before completing 1 h of one-legged kicking exercise (80–100% of maximal work). The combination of skeletal muscle biopsies, stable isotopes, femoral arterial and venous blood samples, and blood flow measurements will allow the measurement of post-exercise skeletal muscle glucose uptake and protein synthesis rates with and without insulin stimulation. The primary outcome is insulin stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake during recovery from exercise. Secondary outcomes include insulin stimulated skeletal muscle protein synthesis during recovery from exercise and phosphoproteomics to identify the intracellular signaling network regulating muscle glucose uptake and protein synthesis. Although this study is restricted to young men, these findings could provide the framework to understand how rapamycin may impact the acute benefits of exercise on substrate metabolism in both older men and women.\nA relatively small trial in the UK, led by Drs. Philip Atherton and Lynne Cox, is aiming to determine how rapamycin affects skeletal muscle and immune function in men between the ages of 50 and 90 years. A total of 16 subjects will be randomized to either 1 mg/day rapamycin or placebo for 16 weeks. Subjects will complete a 2-week rapamycin lead-in before engaging in 14 weeks of unilateral, leg extension resistance exercise (3×/week at 75% of 1 repetition maximum) while the contralateral leg will remain sedentary. Although there may be some crossover effects between the trained and sedentary legs, this trial may be able to determine both the independent and combined effects of rapamycin and resistance exercise on study endpoints. The primary outcomes are the change from baseline in skeletal muscle mass assessed by MRI and ultrasound of the thigh muscles after 5, 8, and 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes include change in skeletal muscle strength (1-RM), power (counter jump movement), and physical function (short-performance physical battery). The combination of muscle biopsy samples and the use of the stable isotope deuterium oxide will be used to measure cumulative skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates. Blood samples taken will be used to assess immune cell senescence and inflammation.\nThe Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity Study (PEARL), led by Dr. James Watson of the University of California, Los Angeles and Dr. Sajad Zalzala of AgelessRx, is now underway. A total of 150 subjects located throughout the USA aged 50–85 have been randomized to receive either 5 mg or 10 mg of rapamycin once per week or a placebo-control. The primary outcome of the 12-month-long trial will be changes in visceral fat as estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary outcomes will include bone density, fat-free mass, changes in blood glucose, HbA1c, and electrolytes, and effects on liver and renal function, as well as adverse events. Outcomes relevant to molecular aging may also include microbiome analysis, DNA methylation clock, and PhenoAge score. A potential limitation is the standardization between DXA scanners located across the country; however, participants will have pre- and post-measurements conducted on the same DXA machine.\nSpecific geriatric conditions\nThe Rapamycin – Effects on Alzheimer’s and Cognitive Health (REACH) trial led by Drs. Mitzi Gonzales, Sudha Seshardi, and collaborators at the University of Texas San Antonio Health Sciences Center is now recruiting subjects to explore the possibility that rapamycin could be used as an intervention in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This trial is based on the extensive pre-clinical evidence that orally administered rapamycin attenuates cerebral mTOR signaling, restores cerebral blood flow, reduces amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau accumulation, and ameliorates cognitive deficits in AD and aged rodent models [42, 97, 98]. In this trial, 40 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or early-stage AD will be randomized to receive 1 mg/day of rapamycin or placebo for 12 months, followed by a 6-month observational period. The safety, efficacy, and feasibility of rapamycin treatment for aMCI/AD will be determined by tracking compliance, adverse events, rapamycin levels within the CSF, and changes in cognition. Molecular effects of the treatment on CSF levels of Aβ and tau will also be determined, and neuroimaging will be performed to examine how the treatment impacts AD biomarkers, including blood flow, glucose metabolism, neurovascular coupling, and cerebral volumetry.\nBased on the lessons learned from previous phase 2b and phase 3 trials (Table 1) [19, 22], a pilot trial was recently completed to test an endpoint that assessed severity rather than incidence of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) caused by a specific virus (COVID-19) in nursing home patients. Specifically, the trial assessed whether 10mg daily dose of the mTOR catalytic inhibitor BEZ235 decreased the incidence of severe COVID-19 in residents of nursing homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak. Results of the clinical trial are pending.\nThe Validating Benefits of Rapamycin for Reproductive Aging Treatment (VIBRANT) trial led by Drs. Samuel Williams and Yousin Suh at Columbia University will explore the benefits of rapamycin in women undergoing early ovarian failure. Fifty subjects are being actively recruited and will be randomized to either 5 mg of rapamycin once weekly or placebo for 3 months, and then followed for 9 months. This trial is based in part on studies in rodents showing that short-term treatment with rapamycin can increase ovarian lifespan [99, 100]. The primary endpoint of this study will be ovarian reserve determined by transvaginal ultrasound, with secondary endpoints related to concentration of reproductive hormones.\nAn upcoming clinical trial led by Dr. Jonathan An at the University of Washington is aiming to start recruitment later in 2023 to study the effects of rapamycin on periodontal disease. This trial is based on pre-clinical work in mice showing that rapamycin can partially restore oral health in aged mice [101, 102]. Approximately 50 subjects aged 50 and up will be recruited and randomized to receive either rapamycin (most likely 5–6 mg per week) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study will be clinical attachment loss, an established clinical readout for the progression of periodontal disease.\nConclusions\nOverall, there is significant interest by the scientific community and greater public to determine if rapamycin can safely and effectively extend healthy longevity in humans like it does in multiple model systems. The a priori goal of this review was to highlight ongoing and upcoming clinical trials testing the safety and utility of rapamycin to intervene in fundamental mechanisms of aging with the goal of slowing, improving, or restoring the age-related decline in physiological function. At the completion of these trials, it is expected that the geroscience community will identify dosing strategies that minimize adverse events for older adults and improve our understanding of whether rapamycin can improve key predictors of clinical outcomes in aging humans either at risk for or with overt, pre-existing geriatric conditions. Positive or null findings will be equally informative on the experimental design of future clinical trials in terms of dosing regimens, pre-specified primary endpoints, candidate subject populations, and statistical approaches. Furthermore, there is a need for the ongoing mTOR inhibitor trials to make data publicly available so that datasets can be combined for further exploratory analyses on dose, safety, aging biomarkers, and overlapping outcomes. Many of these studies have just recently started or will begin enrollment within the next 2 years. Therefore, study details were not always widely available for each protocol. For example, it was unclear whether some studies had a matching placebo and/or if studies were double or single-blinded. Therefore, the evaluation of rigor was not completely possible but, inherently, each of the studies mentioned within this review, including our own, will have strengths and limitations. Additionally, while there is growing infatuation for the potential of using rapamycin for geroprotection, there are currently no human data to suggest that long-term use of mTOR inhibitors can safely extend healthy longevity in humans and underscore the importance of the emerging clinical trials discussed within this review to close this translational knowledge gap.\nSupplementary information\nAcknowledgements\nWe appreciate Drs.

It is diagnosed using a combination of imaging studies, histopathological examinations, and immunohistochemical staining. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, with the goal of achieving a wide local excision and reducing the risk of recurrence. The role of systemic therapies is not well established because of the rarity of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, uncertainty regarding its response to currently approved medications, and lack of randomized controlled trials. We describe the case of an 18-year-old male patient diagnosed with multifocal pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma of the left lower limb who was treated with everolimus in addition to denosumab, achieving a partial response that was consolidated with resection, radiofrequency ablation, and radiotherapy of multiple local lesions, achieving a long-lasting response. Following subsequent disease progression, the patient responded favorably to pazopanib, with no significant toxicities.\nKeywords: Hemangioendothelioma; Hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid; Neoplasms, vascular tissue; Everolimus; Denosumab; Pazopanib\nINTRODUCTION\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is an ultrarare vascular sarcoma that typically affects young adults.(1–3) Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma most commonly presents as a locally aggressive disease, although its metastatic potential has been previously described.(4,5) Treatment is mostly based on a surgical approach, because the benefits of systemic therapy or radiation are not well defined.(6)\nWe report a case of a patient presenting with multifocal PMH in multiple tissue planes of the left lower extremity treated successfully with surgical excision in addition to everolimus, denosumab, pazopanib, radiofrequency ablation, and radiation therapy.\nCASE REPORT\nIn February 2021, an 18-year-old male patient with no known comorbidities presented with pain in his left leg and knee during walking. He denied any history of trauma, and a physical examination revealed no signs of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left knee revealed focal areas of bone signal alteration in the distal femur and subcutaneous tissue. Initially, these findings were interpreted as nonspecific and likely unrelated to the patient's symptoms. A subsequent MRI performed due to persistent symptoms 2 months later demonstrated a significant increase in the dimensions of most of the focal bone lesions described in the previous study, located in the left femur, left tibia, and left fibula, as well as the appearance of new soft tissue masses in multiple tissue planes. Subsequently, a positron emission tomography (PET-CT) revealed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity in multiple small osteolytic lesions affecting the distal femur, patella, tibia, fibula, talus, and calcaneus, all within the left lower limb. These lesions were predominantly cortical, exhibiting periosteal and endosteal erosion, and were associated with soft tissue lesions in the muscular and subcutaneous planes.\nIn June 2021, excisional biopsies were performed on four samples: nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the left thigh, nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the left leg, left distal fibular lesions, and left calcaneal lesions. All four samples were processed for histopathological analysis (Figure 1) and immunohistochemistry (Table 1) to confirm the diagnosis of PMH.\nFigure 1.

In addition, somatic genetic testing (Foundation Heme) was performed. After two doses of denosumab, the patient developed worsening symptoms and a new palpable soft tissue nodule. A new PET-CT scan showed an increase in the FDG uptake of bone lesions as well as in the number, dimensions, and FDG uptake of focal nodular lesions of the subcutaneous tissue/muscle of the left thigh and leg. At that time, the results of the somatic testing were available and showed no reportable genomic alterations (Table 2).\nTable 2.

Denosumab treatment was continued because of the presence of active bone lesions. In October 2022, a dose reduction to 5mg/day was required because of severe mucositis (grade 2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events - CTCAE) refractory to topical symptomatic interventions. In the first everolimus response assessment, PET-CT revealed a partial response (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. PET-CT showing response to everolimus. PET-CT, positron emission tomography-computed tomography.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTherefore, everolimus (5mg/day) combined with denosumab (120mg monthly) was continued. In January 2022, a new PET-CT scan was performed, demonstrating a persistent partial response, although some areas exhibited a slight increase in FDG uptake. No evidence of new lesions was observed. The dose of everolimus was then increased, alternating between 5 and 10mg every other day, and treatment for mucositis was intensified. In April 2022, PET-CT showed that the majority of lesions maintained a partial response, although there were signs of increased glycolytic hypermetabolism in a small focal lesion in the soft tissues of the dorsum of the left midfoot, in the focal lesion in the projection of the soleus muscle of the middle or distal third of the left leg, and in most of the osteolytic lesions in the distal femur, tibia, and fibula on the left.\nIn May 2022, multiple soft tissue tumors of the left thigh, knee, leg, ankle, and foot were surgically resected. In addition, curettage was performed, followed by cementation of the left calcaneal lesion. Intraoperatively, the calcaneal tendon was evaluated, and tumor infiltration was suspected. After an onsite biopsy, the surgeon decided not to remove the entire calcaneal tendon. Moreover, radiofrequency ablation (Medtronics Osteocool™) of multiple lesions of the femur, tibia, fibula, ankle bones, and left foot was required. The pathology report confirmed PMH in all the samples. Most of the lesions had free margins. None of the specimens showed areas of necrosis, although there were occasional areas of fibrosis adjacent to the site of injury. A biopsy of the calcaneal tendon lesion confirmed PMH. Figure 2 shows the pathological findings.\nIn July 2022, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a slight increase in a single lesion located in the myotendinous transition of the calcaneus, which was previously untreated. Subsequently, the patient underwent radiotherapy treatment from 08/29/22 to 09/02/22 at a dose of 2500 cGy (divided into five sessions for the left calcaneal lesion and the same dose for the left fibula head). The patient was closely monitored with imaging examinations every 3 months and remained with no systemic treatment and no evidence of disease progression until May 2023.\nPET-CT performed in May 2023 showed progressive disease with the appearance of new uptake in lytic lesions in the left tarsal cuboid and posterior cortex of the left calcaneus and increased uptake in lytic lesions in the left patella, distal femur, and tibia (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. PET-CT showing progressive disease. PET-CT, positrone emission tomography-computed tomography.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nAt that time, owing to multifocal progression, we decided to pursue systemic therapy. Although the patient responded well to everolimus, mucositis significantly impaired his quality of life during therapy. Therefore, pazopanib treatment was initiated at a standard dose of 800mg/day. Immediately after the initiation of treatment, the patient was admitted to the hospital to treat the erysipelas of the left leg. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed soft tissue infection with no evidence of osteomyelitis.\nThe first PET-CT scan after the start of pazopanib in July 2023 showed a reduction in the uptake of all bone lesions, which was considered a partial response in the femur, tibia, calcaneus, and talus. To date, pazopanib has shown no relevant toxicities. PET-CT performed in October 2023 confirmed an ongoing partial response to pazopanib. Figure 4 shows the timeline of all treatments received by the patient.\nFigure 4. Timeline of diagnostic tests and therapy.\n\nPR: partial response; DP: disease progressive.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe case has been reported in line with the CARE guidelines for case reports.(7)\nThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (CAAE: 77048623.6.0000.0071; #6, 647, 377).\nDISCUSSION\nThe diagnosis and management of ultra-rare sarcomas are challenging for pathologists, orthopedic surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists.(8–10) Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is an ultra-rare indolent vascular tumor initially described as \"pseudomyogenic (fibroma-like) variant of epithelioid sarcoma\" due to the lack of histologic evidence of vascular differentiation.(11) Later, with additional immunohistochemical analyses, clinical recognition, and molecular diagnostics, this entity was better characterized.(12)\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is commonly diagnosed in young adults, with a male predominance of 4–5:1, and a mean age of 30 years.(13) Lower extremities are the most common sites of involvement (54%), as shown in this case report; however, other anatomic primary sites have been described.(1) This clinical entity exhibits locally aggressive behavior in most cases. Moreover, multifocality is present in 66% of the cases, and bone involvement is reported in one-quarter of the patients. Multiple anatomical planes, such as the dermis, subcutis, and skeletal muscle, are involved in >90% of cases with multifocality, as was the case in our patient.(14) The pattern of bone lesions is characterized by cortical and intramedullary lytic lesions with well-defined borders, without signs of local aggressiveness, and a low risk of metastatic disease.(15)\nThe diagnosis is challenging because of the rarity of this condition. In the largest reported series, the duration of symptoms before excision ranged from to 1-24 months (mean, 7 months). In the present case, the time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4 months, which is in line with the literature. Potential differential diagnoses include vascular tumors, such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid angiosarcoma, and non-vascular lesions, such as metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma. Consequently, a comprehensive diagnostic approach consistent with imaging (radiological, magnetic resonance imaging, and PET-CT), in addition to pathological findings, is relevant for a correct diagnosis.(16)\nHistopathologically, the tumor was characterized by epithelioid-to-spindle endothelial cells with dense eosinophilic cytoplasm, few intracytoplasmic lumens, and no apparent vascular differentiation. These components present with mild-to-moderate cytological atypia, low mitotic activity, and admixed neutrophils. Immunophenotype patterns usually show strong positivity for keratin, Fli-1, and ERG, frequently positive for CD31 but negative for CD34; nuclear expression of SMARCB1 (INI-1) is retained.(17) The t(7;19) (q22;q13) translocation has been described in most PMH cases, leading to a fusion between SERPINE1 and FOSB.(18) In addition, other FOSB fusion partners have been described, such as ACTB,(19) WWTR1,(20) CLTC,(21) EGFL7(22) and POTE1.(23,24)\nThe recurrence pattern was mostly localized. Local recurrences and additional nodules in the same anatomic region have been reported in approximately 60% of patients with this diagnosis, usually within the first 2 years after the excision of the primary tumor.(11) The standard treatment for PMH is local excision and/or curettage, although retrospective data have shown a significant percentage of amputations (20.7%).(16) Notably, metastases are rare. In a large series of 50 patients, only one patient developed metastatic disease; however, long-term follow-up data are necessary to assess the frequency of late metastasis.(1)\nEvidence of the efficacy of systemic therapy for PMH is limited. In recent case reports and small case series, chemotherapy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, anti-resorptive bone therapies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been investigated as treatment options, particularly for multifocal or recurrent lesions.(25–29) Table 3 presents a literature review of case reports on the systemic treatment of PMH.\nTable 3.

SERPINE1 encodes a protein within the serine protease inhibitor family, known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). It has been documented that PAI-1 inhibits apoptosis by triggering the Akt pathway. Therefore, mTOR inhibitors are promising therapeutic targets in this setting.(36,37) Ozeki et al. evaluated the efficacy of this agent in the treatment of PMH. A pediatric patient with high mTOR expression in PMH tissue showed a partial response to everolimus.(26) Moreover, Joseph et al.(25) treated a pediatric patient with everolimus and PMH, revealing a tuberous sclerosis 1(TSC1) mutation. TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressors that inhibit Rheb, a small GTPase essential for mTOR activation.(38)\nJoseph et al.(25) reported the only case with an actionable mutation in DNA sequencing with a partial response to targeted treatment. Despite performing next-generation sequencing, we did not find any genomic alterations in our patient's tumor, and only variants of uncertain significance were identified. Therefore, the treatment the patient received was not targeted to any specific mutations but was based on previously reported drugs used for this disease.(38)\nDenosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets RANK ligands and has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, bone metastasis, and giant cell tumors.(39) Otani et al. treated a single case of PMH of the bone with monthly denosumab administration, which resulted in symptomatic relief of ankle pain.(28) Pasricha et al. used a six-weekly basis Denosumab protocol to achieve stable disease and symptomatic relief after 6 months.(29)\nAs our patient showed disease progression with denosumab and significant toxicity with everolimus, the second-line treatment was pazopanib. The efficacy of TKIs has been described in two previous case reports. The first study to use pazopanib was conducted by Alkanash et al. A 35-year-old male with PMH in his right lower limb was treated with first-line pazopanib and achieved a sustained partial response for 6 months after treatment initiation.(32) Van Jzendoorne et al. described the case of a 17-year-old male who had multiple skin lesions on the head and neck, was diagnosed with PMH, and was treated with telatinib, a multi-tyrosine inhibitor. He had a complete response and continued to use the drug for 9 years when the treatment was stopped because of the unavailability of the drug. Four years after having stopped the medication discontinuation, the patient remained in complete response. In addition, this group created a model using normal endothelial cells, the most likely precursors of PMH, expressing the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion. This fusion product can control the expression and enhance PDGFRA and FLT1 levels. In this model, telatinib effectively inhibited the surface receptors FLT1, FLT4, and PDGFRA and disrupted the self-regulated expression of the fusion product. Consequently, telatinib and other TKIs can indirectly affect the expression of SERPINE1-FOSB and may serve as important therapeutic options for individuals with multifocal, unresectable PMH.(33)\nCONCLUSION\nFurther studies are required to determine the optimal dose, duration, and sequence of systemic therapies for pseudomyogenic hemangioendotheliomas. Here, we describe a case of sequential therapy with everolimus, denosumab, and pazopanib. Our report highlights that the use of systemic therapy in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma represents a significant option for the management of this rare and challenging tumor, especially in cases where surgical resection is not feasible or has resulted in local recurrence or metastasis.\nREFERENCES\n\n1.Hornick JL, Fletcher CD.

This tumor is rare; therefore, detailed information regarding this tumor is still lacking.\nHere, we report a case of a man in his 20s presenting with left foot pain for about one year. Imaging showed a 2-cm ovoid, cortically based lesion with a lytic defect of the cortex at the fifth metatarsal proximal shaft. Histologically, the lesion presented as an infiltrating proliferation of distinctly myoid-appearing spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and mildly atypical vesicular nuclei. Scant mitoses were identified with no areas of necrosis. Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin expression as well as CD31 and ERG. CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells, and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present.\nOver half of the patients with PMH develop multifocal lesions, often involving several tissue planes; however, distant metastasis is very infrequent. This patient underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the prognosis of these lesions.\nKeywords: solitary lesion, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, indolent, vascular, sarcoma, epithelioid, hemangioendothelioma\nIntroduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is an endothelial neoplasm, mostly indolent and with low-grade malignancy, having several different classifications. The current nomenclature was originally described by Hornick and Fletcher (2011), in which its myoid and epithelioid-like histologic pattern is defined as \"pseudomyogenic\" [1]. It is predominantly found in young adult males, at approximately 30 years of age, and in the distal extremities [1]. This vascular neoplasm is multifocal and can involve the dermis, subcutis, and bone [2]. The multifocality of these tumors tends to involve the same local anatomical regions as the original tumor [3]. This tumor is rare; therefore, investigation for additional detailed information regarding this tumor is warranted.\nCase presentation\nA male in his 20s presented with increasing pain in his left foot for the past year. He had a history of hypertension but had no other medical problems or trauma. A physical exam revealed tenderness over the fifth metatarsal, particularly at the proximal shaft. There was no warmth, erythema, or lymphadenopathy, and a reassuring distal neurovascular exam. Plain X-rays revealed a 2-cm ovoid lytic lesion in the fifth metatarsal, with a saucer-like deformity and significant scalloping, favoring reparative granuloma, chondroma, periosteal desmoid, or other neoplasms (Figure 1). The lesion was also identified on CT and MRI. A biopsy of the lesion was taken at the time of surgery.\nFigure 1.

Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin AE1&3 expression, as well as CD31 and ERG (Figure 3). CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells (Figure 3), and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present.\nFigure 3.

(D) Diffusely positive ERG stain (400x magnification).\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) panel with 58 gene fusions (Cleveland Clinic Foundation panel) was performed and no gene fusion was detected. These findings are consistent with an epithelioid sarcoma-like epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), with a differential diagnosis including epithelioid vascular neoplasm and epithelioid sarcoma. The retention of INI1 expression, strong CD31 positivity, and lack of diffuse CD34 argue against epithelioid sarcoma, which was described as PMH.\nThe decision was made to treat the lesion with debridement, curettage, grafting, and internal fixation. Post-surgical follow-up positron emission tomography (PET) scans were negative, and CT scans have shown progressive healing of the pathologic fracture and the cavitating cortical lesion (Figure 4). There was no evidence of recurrent tumor, including local recurrence or local spread to other sites after seven years of follow-up.\nFigure 4.

(A) Anterolateral view; (B) anterior view.\nDiscussion\nPMH is a rare tumor, mainly occurring in males with an average age of 31 years [1]. PMH can be asymptomatic, but the most common symptom is pain in the region of the tumor [4]. It most commonly occurs in the dermis and subcutis tissue layer, yet approximately half of the cases have intramuscular lesions, and 20% are intraosseous [1]. Grossly, 70% of these lesions are multifocal, unlike in this case as a solitary lesion, and average in size between 1 and 2.5 cm [2,5]. It is a mostly indolent tumor with a low likelihood to metastasize, as also demonstrated in this case [1]. The main treatment for PMH is debridement; however, chemotherapy is also used. Targeted angiogenic drugs have been proposed, specifically as a treatment for vascular tumors. Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitor drug in which mTOR is prevented from activating protein synthesis and angiogenesis. Sirolimus (rapamycin) and derivatives have been predicted to be an effective and less toxic treatment compared to chemotherapy for PMH [2].\nHistologic morphology of PMH consists of neoplastic cells that are enlarged, spindled, and with bright eosinophilic cytoplasm that can mimic rhabdomyoblasts. They contain mild nuclear atypia and infrequent mitotic activity [1,6].\nPMH has an inclusive differential diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteoblastoma, and vascular tumors [4]. PMH has presenting similarities with epithelioid sarcomas, such as presenting in the skin and soft tissue in the distal extremities and having diffuse keratin positivity [1]. This case represents the importance of identifying and distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors with poorer prognoses. To differentiate between PMH and epithelioid sarcoma, as both have cytokeratin positivity, epithelioid sarcoma expresses MNF116 and AE1&3 and has a loss of expression of INI1 (90%) and CD34 (50%) [3,7]. PMH is also negative for pan-cytokeratin, EMA, and CD34, in which 50% are positive in epithelioid sarcoma [1,3,7]. Histologically, PMH can mimic other skeletal muscle tumors; however, PMH lacks expression for actin, MyoD1, and desmin [1,6,8]. PMH usually shows reactivity with vascular markers, including CD31, FLI1, and ERG, as well as co-expresses vimentin and keratins such as AE1&3, CK7, and CAM5.2 [6].\nAnother useful tool in the diagnosis of PMH is the use of FOSB immunohistochemistry. The FOSB expression for PMH is strongly positive [9]. The SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusion due to the chromosomal translocation t(7;19)(q22;q13) has been identified in several cases [6,10]. The WHO 2020 classification reported on recently identified genetic alterations in which PMH has SERPINE1-FOSB and ACTB-FOSB, which can be useful when distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors [10]. The differential diagnosis for PMH can be broad, and the rarity emphasizes the importance of immunohistochemical stains and increases the possibility of being overlooked.\nConclusions\nPMH is a rare neoplasm, particularly with the involvement of the bone. It is characterized as a multifocal, male-predominant tumor with predominantly spindled epithelioid morphology and positive keratin markers. We presented a patient who underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the importance of the identification of these lesions and their effects on treatment and prognosis.\nThe content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

We present a 35-year-old male with an unremarkable medical history, who was referred to a sarcoma clinic complaining of right heel pain with equinus deformity and a mass in his right lower limb for 6 months.

Long-term follow-up is still needed, however further studies are vital to clarify the role of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor therapy.\nKeywords: sarcoma, tki, epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, pseudomyogenic hamangioendothelioma, pazopanib\nIntroduction\nSoft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a heterogeneous group of tumors with over one hundred histologic subtypes that requires a pathologist specialized in sarcoma for diagnosis [1]. Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE), also known as epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma (ES-H), was first described in 2013 by WHO. It is a vascular tumor biologically behaving like benign hemangioma and malignant angiosarcoma and rarely metastasizes [2,3]. In the fifth edition of WHO classifications of bone and soft tissue tumors published in 2020, PHE was further characterized by a balanced t(7;19) translocation causing a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion [4].\nPHE predominantly affects young adults at age of 20-40 years with a male to female ratio of 4.6:1 with muscle (34%) being the most commonly affected tissue followed by dermis (31%), subcutaneous tissue (20%), and bone (14%). Most commonly, it affects the lower extremity in deep soft tissues accounting for 60% of the cases found in the literature [5,6]. Studies on PHE management are still lacking, particularly in patient subgroups [7]. In the present case report, we report the clinical activity of pazopanib in a Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma patient.\nCase presentation\nWe present a 35-year-old male with an unremarkable medical history who was referred to a sarcoma clinic complaining of right heel pain with equinus deformity and a mass in his right lower limb for 6 months. He underwent an excisional biopsy in a community hospital that came suspicious for neoplasia and inconclusive. On examination, his right foot showed equinus deformity along with multiple skin nodules in the tibia. The neurovascular exam was unremarkable.\nInitial diagnostic MRI revealed nonspecific multiple subcutaneous and muscular enhancing nodules associated with osteopenia involving the right tibia and foot. PET CT done in September 2021 showed FDG-avidity in the deep subcutaneous/intramuscular foci involving the right lower limb. No suspicious FDG-avid lesions were seen elsewhere (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. FDG PET-CT whole body.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nFDG-avidity in the deep subcutaneous/intramuscular foci involving the right lower limb\nBiopsy was repeated at our center and reported as Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma. Immunohistochemistry panel revealed: SMA (-), DESMIN (-), S100 (-), CD34 (-), AE1/AE3 (+), CD31 (+); IHC staining for FOSB was not available in our laboratory.\nThe case was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumor board and the consensus was to go for systemic therapy. The patient was started on pazopanib 800 mg daily on October first. Subsequently, it was decreased to 600 mg due to GI intolerance with good clinical response in terms of decreased pain. Patient had imaging re-evaluation with leg MRI done in December 2021 that demonstrated a mild interval decrease in the size of the previously described multiple scattered subcutaneous and intramuscular enhancing nodules of the right leg and foot with the largest lesion in the posterolateral aspect of the lateral head gastrocnemius muscle currently measuring 0.5 x 1 x 1.7 cm (previously was 1.1 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm) in maximum AP, transverse and craniocaudal dimensions, respectively (Figure 2). No new soft tissue lesion is seen.\nFigure 2. MRI right lower limb pre/post pazopanib .\n\nOpen in a new tab\nA&B MRI right lower limb post pazopanib\nC&D MRI right lower limb pre pazopanib\nAnother dose reduction in pazopanib was required to 400 mg due to significant fatigue and anorexia. He was also noted to develop generalized skin and hair hypopigmentation. In March 2022, MRI to assess response was done again showing disease stability.\nDiscussion\nThere are few reports on PHE. In 2017, Pradhan et al. have reported 8 patients with males representing 7 out of 8 patients (87.5%) and a mean age at presentation of 29 years. In this case series, the mean tumor size was 1.9cm ranging between 0.3 and 5.5 cm. The most common site of involvement was the leg in 6 patients (75%) with the remaining two cases occurring on the arm [8]. Half of the cases involved the bone, while the other half were restricted to the superficial and deep soft tissue (25% and 25% respectively). At presentation, a total of five cases (62.5%) showed multifocal disease. The second case series reported in 2011 by Hornick and Fletcher describe fifty patients with a male predominance (82%) and mean age of 31 years at diagnosis [6]. In more than half of the cases (54%), the primary site was in the leg, followed by 24% on the arm, 18% on the trunk, and 4% on the neck. Tumor involved the dermis and subcutaneous tissue in 52%, followed by skeletal muscle 34%, and bone 14%. Again, 66% showed multifocal disease at presentation. Our patient sex, age, and tumor characteristics were consistent with previously published data.\nSince Pseudomyogenic (epithelioid sarcoma-like) Hemangioendothelioma (PHE) was introduced as a new distinguished entity of vascular endothelial neoplasm in 2013, no standard of care or treatment was established for such cases. The literature reports various treatment options such as local control (surgical resection, and cryotherapy) and systemic therapy (chemotherapy, Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI), bone resorptive agent, and Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor like bevacizumab) [9].\nIn a report of 58 clinical cases of PHE with bone and soft tissue involvement, 69% underwent local treatment with excision or curettage, whereas 20.7% had amputations. Seven patients were treated with mTOR inhibitors and 4 patients with anti-resorptive treatments in those with multifocal lesions not amenable to local treatment [10]. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and mTOR have showed clinical and radiological benefit [11]. Gemcitabine + docetaxel regimen was used in one patient with favorable response. However, it did not yield tumor shrinkage in another patient [11]. DNA sequencing of one patient revealed a pathogenic mutation of the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1); everolimus was administered for this patient resulting in mild shrinkage of PHE metastases [11].\nTelatinib was the first investigational TKI tried in PHE In 2018 [12]. In that study, the patient with extensive PHE was given telatinib, and showed a durable complete remission. The in vitro model for PHE showed that telatinib affected the self-regulated expression of the fusion gene throughout VEGF- and PDGF-receptor signaling and regulating SERPINE1 [12]. Our patient has received pazopanib which is a multi-target TKI and demonstrated clinical benefit with disease regression that is durable with 6 months of follow-up. Similar to Telatinib, Pazopanib is a promising treatment option for PHE that warrants further study in the future. Pazopanib is showing promise in this rare disease and its role should be explored further in this tumor type.\nConclusions\nWith the inadequate knowledge of the pathogenetic mechanisms and the lack of randomized controlled trials, treatment of PHE remains unclear, and its indolent behavior makes extensive surgery with amputation more aggressive than needed. However, further studies with more patients are required to clarify the role of pazopanib in PHE.\nThe content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

In cancer, mTOR is frequently hyperactivated which promotes cancer development and progression. In certain cancers, resistance to antineoplastic agents such as topoisomerase 1, topoisomerase 2 inhibitors and methotrexate can be overcome with a synergistic combination with mTOR inhibitors [3,4]. Furthermore, mTOR activates the degradation of cyclin dependent kinases such as CDK1 which increases synthesis of dihydrofolate reductases. By decreasing this enzyme, mTOR inhibitors like sirolimus and temsirolimus, promote tumour sensitivity to agents such as methotrexate [4].\nRecent development has made cancer treatment move on from conventional cytotoxic drugs to agents that target specific proteins like mTOR called mTOR inhibitors. A very common mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, is a bacterial product that inhibits mTOR by associating with its intracellular receptor [5]. [Currently, two mTOR inhibitors, temsirolimus and everolimuswhich are derivatives of rapamycin, temsirolimus(Torisel: Wyeth-Ayerst, Charlotte, NC, U.S.A.) and everolimus(Certican: Novartis Pharmaceuticals, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) ] are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and mantle cell lymphoma, effectively translating this paradigm into the clinical setting [6].\nmTOR inhibitors (like other drugs) have an adverse effect profile. Clinical trials have had mixed opinions regarding drug efficacy [7]. Examples of the neoplasias with promising results include pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, follicular lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma while the ones with negative results include glioblastoma multiforme and small cell carcinoma of lung. Although relatively safe, these drugs are associated with some unique adverse side effects, such as hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and pneumonitis, which require monitoring and may require clinical intervention [6]. Clinical utility of mTOR inhibitors depends on appropriate selection of patients and type of cancer. Mutations in the mTOR pathway of cancer cells may result in resistance to mTOR inhibition and prevent any action of the mTOR inhibitors. Examples include mutations of FKBP-12 proteins, mammalian 14-3-3 proteins ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated) cells, all responsible for growth of cancer cells.\nA new wave of clinical trials has commenced using a second generation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitors. First generation of mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin, showed certain limitations by blocking only C1 isoform, inducing feedback activation of Akt and showing resistance to mTORC2 [8]. The newer agents can inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 by targeting kinase domains as an effective means with a high degree of selectivity [9]. For example, Agent OSI-027 (OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY, U.S.A.) is currently in phase 1 of trial and being evaluated on patients with lymphoma or solid tumors [9]. XL765 (Exelixis, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.) is also in phase 1 of clinical trial and being assessed in combination therapies [9].\nIn contrast to the older mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin which blocked only C1 isoform, the newer agents can inhibit both mTORC1 and 2 with high degree of selectivity [10]. Further clinical trials are necessitated to determine the therapeutic uses, predictive biomarkers and clinical efficacy for this novel class of anti-cancer agents.\nAuthors' contributions\nHR: Decided the topic to write about and made edits in resubmission.

The aim of this study was to present a rare case of PHE in the back and to review its clinicopathological features, therapeutic modalities, evolutionary aspects and prognosis.\nCase presentation\nWe report the case of a 21-year-old man who consulted for a multinodular mass at the scapula level, that increased in size within 2 months. An excisional surgery was performed. Macroscopic examination showed ulcerated centimetric nodules with a crusty surface. Microscopic examination showed a multinodular proliferation arranged in clusters, made of spindle cells or epithelioid cells with variable atypia. Immunohistochemical study showed the expression ofAE1-AE3, ERG and INI-1. There was no staining for EMA, CD34, and CD-31. The diagnosis of PHE was retained.\nDiscussion\nPHE affects young adult males and usually develops in the extremities. Clinically, more than half of the patients present with local recurrence. Distant metastases have also been reported. Microscopically, PHE resembles a myoid tumor or epithelioid sarcoma because of the abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and cell shape. Tumor cells express cytokeratin and inconsistently CD34 and CD31. Hence the need to complete the study of ERG and INI1 expression in all soft tissue epithelioid tumors. The translocation t(7;19)(q22; q13) as well as the expression of FOSB in immunohistochemistry allow to differentiate with epithelioid sarcoma. Surgery is the treatment option.\nConclusion\nPHE is a confusing entity with several mesenchymal neoplasms that must be carefully differentiated.

Introduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE), a rare and recently discovered endothelial tumor, was formerly known as a fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma due to its physical resemblance to that tumor. PHE is an infrequently metastasizing intermediate-grade tumor, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2020 [1]. Young adults, particularly males, are often found to have PHE [2]. Although it can occur anywhere, this tumor often affects the extremities, mainly the lower limbs. The case of a young man diagnosed with PHE in the back reported here emphasizes the importance of a proper differential diagnosis in order to protect individuals whose PHE can be confused for more aggressive sarcomas. The aim of this study was to review clinicopathological features, emphasize on differential diagnosis and discuss therapeutic modalities and prognosis of this rare entity.\n2. Case presentation\nA 21-year-old man with no past medical or trauma history consulted for a back, at the scapula level, multinodular mass that increased rapidly in size within 2 months. A wide excision surgery was performed. Macroscopic examination of the skin specimen showed multiple ulcerated centimetric nodules with a crusty surface. Microscopic examination showed a multinodular proliferation arranged in clusters sometimes delimiting slits. It was made of spindle cells or epithelioid cells with brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm sometimes mimicking rhabdomyoblasts (Fig. 1). Tumor cells contained a nucleated nuclei with variable atypia. Mitotic figures were rarely observed without any atypical mitotic figure. No necrosis was noticed. The tumor ulcerated the epidermis, proliferated throughout the dermis, subcutaneous fat tissue and infiltrated the skeletal muscle in depth. The immunohistochemical study showed the expression of Cytokeratin (AE1-AE3) (Fig. 2), and INI-1. No staining for EMA, CD34 (Fig. 3), CD-31, PS-100 and Desmin was observed. ERG was positive in tumor cells (Fig. 4). The tumor was completely resected with safe margin status. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PHE was retained. A thoraco-abdominal pelvic scan was performed and showed no distant localization. No recurrence was observed six months after the resection. The patient will be followed every 6 months for 4 years with complete clinical examination.\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nHematoxylin and Eosin staining of a pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma.\nA: Tumor arranged in clusters composed of a mix of spindle and epithelioid cells (×100).\nB: Epithelioid and tumor cells showing mild nuclear atypia and rare mitosis (×400).\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells showing an intense and diffuse positivity for keratin AE1/AE3 (×400).\nFig. 3.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells negative for CD34 with positive internal control (×400).\nFig. 4.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells positive for ERG (×400).\nThe work has been reported in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria [3].\n3. Discussion\nSeveral publications have reported on the clinical and pathological features of PHE. Males are more likely than females to develop the tumor [2] and young adults in the third or early fourth decade have the highest incidence rates [2], [4]. In 60 % of the cases, it affects the lower body; the upper body and trunk are less frequently affected [5]. In our case, the lesion involved the back.\nPatients with PHE may present with pain in half of the cases or may be asymptomatic [5]. Our patient consulted for a back mass that increased in size rapidly.\nPHE can be multifocal, affecting several tissue planes in about two thirds of patients. Most patient's lesions are in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Tumor size ranges from a few millimeters to a few centimeters for PHE. Superficial lesions can manifest as ulcerated nodules mimicking an epithelioid sarcoma [6] or a dermatofibroma [7]. In our case, the lesion was centimetric and presented as nodules with a crusty surface.\nMicroscopically, the tumor's histological architecture is vaguely nodular, and it occasionally exhibits a desmoplastic reaction as it infiltrates the adipose or skeletal muscle tissue around it. The tumor cells are organized in sheets or short fascicles within a background of inflammatory infiltrates that vary in prominence and are typically made up of neutrophils, or less frequently, lymphocytes, plasma cells, or eosinophils. In exceptional cases, a myxoid background is observed. Tumor cells range from spindle to round and epithelioid. Transitional forms have been described [2]. Rhabdomyoblast-like cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei can be found in some areas. Regardless of the morphology, the cells usually feature a highly eosinophilic cytoplasm, bland nuclei with fine chromatin, and variably discernible nucleoli. Most cases of nuclear pleomorphism are mild to moderate; a few cases exhibit significant nuclear atypia. Typically, there are fewer than 5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields, although there have been certain cases where there have been more mitoses. Intratumoral hemorrhage or the development of vascular channels are often absent in the tumor. Geographic necrosis, a hallmark of epithelioid sarcoma, is uncommon. A few intracytoplasmic vacuoles suggestive of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma may occasionally be seen in rare situations [8].\nAlthough PHE expresses vascular immunohistochemistry antibodies, conventional hematoxylin-eosin examinations may not often show morphologic signs of vascular differentiation, and more researches are required to validate endothelial differentiation.\nPHE stains for Cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), ERG, FLI1, and FOSB [2], [9], [10]. Hornick et al. [2] reported that 22/47 cases expressed CD31. In some cases, it is possible to see focal staining for epithelial membrane antigen and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Importantly, integrase interactor 1 (INI-1) exhibits complete nuclear expression within every case. In this study, tumor cells expressed Cytokeratin (AE1-AE3), ERG and INI-1 and were negative for EMA, CD34, and CD-31 which is in accordance to literature.\nOn a molecular level, a balanced t(7;19)(q22;q13) translocation resulting in the fusion of the SERPINE1 and FOSB genes was discovered by Walther et al. [11] who employed cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, messenger RNA sequencing, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Fos family, which also includes the smaller splice variants Fra-1 and Fra-2, dimerizes with Jun proteins to form the AP-1 transcriptional factor complex, which includes FOSB. This family is associated with the occurrence of several malignancies, including colorectal, endometrial, and breast tumors [12]. Since SERPINE1 is thought to be a FOSB promoter and this translocation is exclusive to soft tissue tumors, it is thought to be pathognomonic for PHE [13].\nEpithelioid sarcoma is the most crucial differential diagnosis to rule out. Both epithelioid sarcoma and PHE share several clinical characteristics in common, including the tendency to affect young patients, preference for soft tissue in the distal extremities, epithelioid and spindle cell shape, and diffuse keratin expression. Additionally, FLI1 and ERG are positive in some epithelioid sarcoma patients. Epitheloid sarcoma is a more aggressive tumor than PHE with a higher propensity for local metastasis and recurrence [14]. Thus, it is crucial to distinguish between epithelioid sarcoma and PHE due to these differences. In addition to geographic necrosis, epithelioid sarcoma exhibits increased nuclear atypia. It generally lacks reactivity to CD31, FLI1, and INI-1. The absence or mild immunoreactivity for ERG can be beneficial, while epithelioid sarcomas are commonly ERG+ when antibodies against the N-terminus are used [15]. In addition, a study showed that 51/97 cases (52.6 %) of epithelioid sarcoma positive for CD34; while CD34 is consistently negative in PHE [8].\nIn some PHE cases, focal nuclear atypia and enhanced mitotic activity may prompt the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma. Most epithelioid angiosarcoma cases, unlike PHE, have vascular channels or cysts lined by malignant endothelial cells. Furthermore, as CD34 is often positive in angiosarcoma and negative in PHE, it will help in resolving that differential diagnosis.\nSurgery, including wide excision, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are used as treatment options. Distant metastasis only occurred in 3 patients (5 %) and was discovered 4, 8.5, and 16 years after the initial diagnosis. A second patient's concomitant squamous cell carcinoma caused their death [16]. Twenty-six patients (43 %) had new lesions or signs of a local recurrence in the same area as the original tumor; these recurrences were primarily noticed in the first year following diagnosis. Interesting though, a lot of the lesions remained unchanged throughout time [2], [7]. In this report, the patient is doing well, and no recurrence was observed six months after the resection.\n4. Conclusion\nPHE is a rare vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that has been documented in several body sites. It exhibits a clinical presentation resembling epithelioid sarcoma. It can be difficult to diagnose this tumor without morphologic evidence of a vascular pattern, thus an immunohistochemistry panel is needed. The clinical course of PHE appears to be variable, with frequent local recurrence but a low rate of distant metastases. Prolonged intervals of follow-up are advised due to the real, although slight, potential of distant metastasis developing several years after the initial diagnosis.\nEthical approval\nNo ethical approval.\nConsent\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

We associated the mutation of the gene signature resulted from the stepwise Cox regression with the 1661 patients’ survival. Other 553 ICI-treated patients were collected from 6 cohorts for validation. We also performed this survival association in patients without ICI treatment from MSKCC as discovery (n = 2244) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as validation (n = 763). Pathway enrichment analysis were performed using transcriptome profiles from TCGA and IMvigor210 trial to investigate the potential mechanism.\nResults\nWe identified 8 genes involved in mTOR pathway, including FGFR2, PIK3C3, FGFR4, FGFR1, FGF3, AKT1, mTOR, and RPTOR, resulted from stepwise Cox regression in discovery (n = 1661). In both discovery (n = 1661) and validation (n = 553), the mutation of the 8-gene signature was associated with better survival of the patients treated with ICI, which was independent of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and mainly attributed to the missense mutations. This survival association was not observed in patients without ICI therapy. Intriguingly, the mutation of the 8-gene signature was associated with increased TMB and PD1/PD-L1 expression. Immunologically, pathways involved in anti-tumor immune response were enriched in presence of this mutational signature in mTOR pathway, leading to increased infiltration of immune effector cells (e.g., CD8 + T cells, NK cells, and M1 macrophages), but decreased infiltration of immune inhibitory M2 macrophages.\nConclusions\nThese results suggested that mTOR pathway gene mutations were predictive of better survival upon ICI treatment in multiple cancers, likely by its association with enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Larger studies are warranted to validate our findings.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-022-03436-1.\nKeywords: mTOR pathway, Cancer, ICI, TMB, Prognosis\nIntroduction\nImmune escape of cancer cells driven by immune checkpoints, including PD-1 and CTLA4, yielded hot-spots to be targeted in the recent years [1, 2]. The treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) prolonged survival for cancer patients [3, 4] and had been adopted in neoadjuvant therapy [5] and frontline therapy [6] of advanced cancers. However, the prediction of the ICI response remains challenging [7], because a considerable number of patients cannot obtain long-term clinical benefit from the agent in presence of well recognized predictors, including microsatellite instability (MSI) [8], high PD-L1 expression [9], and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) [10]. In the clinical practice, the survival upon ICI treatment also seemed different among patients with similar level of above biomarkers, highlighting the need for innovative biomarkers to guide ICI treatment decision.\nmTOR pathway was well recognized as simulators for cancer malignancy in multiple cancers. Recently, it was also known as key modulator for cancer immunity by its function in cell metabolism [11–13]. Deletion of mTOR blunted immune cell function [13] and down-regulated the PD-L1 expression in cancers [14]. It was reported that the functional loss of mTOR caused abolishment of response to cytokines, followed by silence of transcription factors specific for CD4 + T helper linage differentiation [15, 16]. Unlike these CD4 + linage, mTOR pathway activation might antagonize T regulatory cells differentiation, likely due to the stimulation of anabolic glycolysis metabolism but not fat acid production needed for T regulatory cells generation [3, 17]. Of notice, the activation of mTOR complex1 (mTORC1) promoted a series of transcription factors, followed by increased production of enzymes prerequisite for lipid synthesis, glycolysis, and glutaminolysis, leading to metabolism switch from naive T cells to effector T cells [18, 19]. Collectively, these previous observations advance our understanding of the role mTOR pathway may play in metabolism reprogramming that is essential for generation of immune effector cells in cancer microenvironment.\nBecause of the relationship between mTOR pathway and cancer immunity, we hypothesized that genetic mutations in mTOR pathway may affect the cancer immunity microenvironment and predict the response to ICI treatment for cancer patients. To test this hypothesis, we performed a two-stage survival association study and identified an 8-gene signature in mTOR pathway whose mutation was associated with better survival in cancer patients received ICI treatment. Mutation of this 8-gene signature was associated with increased genetic alterations in DNA repair genes, which was a potential reason underlying its association with increased TMB. The TMB state did not alter the trend towards better response to ICI treatment in presence of the mutation in the mTOR pathway signature, highlighting its potential use in clinical practice independent of TMB. Importantly, this pathway-derived mutation caused enrichment in metabolism and anti-tumor immune pathways, leading to increased infiltration of immune effector cells in cancers. Together, mTOR pathway mutations in tumors may result in immunologically “hot” microenvironment sensitive to ICI treatment.\nMaterials and methods\nWe presented the workflow and summary of the present study in Fig. 1.\nFig. 1.\n\nThe workflow and summary of the present study\nGenes identification in mTOR pathway\nWe searched for PathCards database (https://pathcards.genecards.org) and identified genes involved in mTOR pathway. We compared the MSK-IMPACT, PGDx elio Tissue Complete, and Foundation One, the three widely used next generation sequencing (NGS) panel in clinical trial of TMB, for the mTOR pathway genes involved. We next scanned the mutation information in our discovery dataset of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) study and identified genes with available mutation information for further survival analysis.\nPatients and two-stage survival analysis\nWe included patients who received at least one dose of ICI treatment for two-stage survival analysis. The ICI treatment including anti-PD1 (e.g., nivolumab and pembrolizumab), anti-PDL1 (e.g., atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab) and anti-CTLA4 (e.g., ipilimumab and tremelimumab) agent. In the discovery, we included 1661 patients from a MSKCC cohort that investigated the association of TMB and ICI treatment [10]. We incorporated the 23 mTOR pathway genes with available mutation information into stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model. Then, we generated the optimal fitted Cox model and selected the variables/genes iterated out. We integrated the variables/genes as a whole signature to explore the survival association in the comparison of mutant- versus wild-type cancer patients treated with ICI. In the validation, we included other 553 patients treated with ICI from other 6 independent published studies for survival association [20–25]. To exclude the possibility that mTOR pathway mutations was a prognostic marker regardless of the ICI treatment, we also associated the mutation states with survival of non-ICI treated patients with 2244 patients from the MSKCC study as discovery and 763 advanced cancer patients from TCGA as validation. All survival analysis were visualized by Kaplan–Meier curve with log-rank test. To quantify the death risk, we also perform multivariate Cox regression for survival analysis with adjustment of age, gender, TMB and treatment. We adopted the restricted mean survival time (RMST) method for multivariate survival comparisons in the case of unmet requirements for Cox assumptions. Hazard ratio (HR) and life expectancy ratio (LER) were used to express the adjusted results for Cox and RMST model, respectively. Because the data for objective response rate (ORR) and durable clinical benefit (DCB) was limited, we also combined the two-stage patients available for these data and compare the ORR and DCB based on the mutation states of the signature using chi-square test.\nMutation frequency and distribution across cancer types\nWe extracted 48,834 cancer patients from 188 non-redundant studies deposited in cbioportal database, and further identified 44,078 patients with available mutation information in 8-gene signature in mTOR pathway, including FGFR2, PIK3C3, FGFR4, FGFR1, FGF3, AKT1, mTOR, and RPTOR. We calculated the mutation frequency of these 8 genes as well as their integrated mutation frequency across multiple cancer types. The MAF files of TCGA were also used to plot the mutation exclusion pattern among them.\nMutation types and survival\nWe performed subgroup analysis according to the mutation types to explore its effect on patients’ survival upon immune checkpoint blockade. Because of the limited sample size in some rare types of mutations, patients were divided into those with missense mutation and others without this type of mutation. Then Kaplan–Meier plot with log-rank test, along with multivariate analysis (e.g., Cox regression for discovery and RMST analysis for validation) were used for survival comparison.\nInteraction with TMB and survival\nWe associated the mutation states of the 8-gene signature with TMB of 5646 cancer patients from MSKCC cohort and validated this association in TCGA including 10,163 patients. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the means of TMB between two groups because of the abnormal distribution of the data. We also tested the survival association of the mutation states in low- (< 10 mut/Mb) and high-TMB (> 10 mut/Mb) patients treated with ICI in MSKCC cohort. In the validation of independent published studies for survival interaction with TMB, a cutoff of 10mut/Mb was also used in the next-generation sequencing study for TMB classification, and the upper quartile of TMB was used for classification in whole-exon sequencing studies. Because decreased sample size in subgroup division that may introduce statistical bias, we also pooled the results in discovery and validation by meta-analysis with random effects model.\nMutations and the activation status of mTOR pathway\nAs we know, the activation or inactivation of mTOR pathway influence its target genes. To explore whether the mutations may affect the activation status of mTOR pathway, we associated the 8-gene signature mutation in mTOR pathway with mRNA expression of the well recognized target genes using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\nImmunological phenotype and mechanism\nTo explain the relationship between 8-gene signature mutation in mTOR pathway and increased TMB, we asked whether there is an association between the signature mutation with genetic mutations involved in DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Then, we extracted the transcriptome data to calculate immune phenotype (e.g., immune cells inflammation, antigen presentation, and neoantigen production) of cancer patients according to published TCGA studies [26, 27]. With Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we explored the impact of the signature mutation on immune phenotype using TCGA pan-cancer database. Specially, we listed the genes involved in cancer immune casecade, including antigen presentation, costimulatory/coinhibitory signals, related ligand and receptor, and cell adhesion. We computed the fold change in these genes in the comparison of mutant- versus wild-type patients and visualized it in one heatmap. We also explored the impact of the 8-gene signature mutation on expression of immune checkpoint and chemokine genes using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out to investigate the potential mechanism underlying the observation of immune phenotype in the comparison of mutant- versus wild-type patients. We further validated the GSEA results from TCGA by 275 advanced cancer patients in IMvigor210 clinical trial.\nClinical case report\nWe reported one case with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma in our center with AKT1 mutation, who was received two cycle treatment of 200 mg pembrolizumab upon initial diagnosis. The patient has signed a written informed consent to denote related clinical data for the purpose of scientific research. We got the computed tomography images before and after the pembrolizumab treatment, in order to visualize the treatment response.\nMutations in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and ICI treatment\nBy extraction of sequencing data from blood TMB study [28], we investigated whether there was a survival association of the cfDNA mutations in mTOR pathway with ICI treatment outcome. We also explored the clinical outcome in the comparison of docetaxel versus atezolizumab treatment in mutant-type patients.\nStatistical tools\nWe performed all survival analysis and genetic analysis in the present study by R version 4.1.0, with two-side P < 0.05 deemed as statistically significant.\nResults\nmTOR pathway genes, patients, and two-stage survival analysis\nWe conducted a two-stage analysis (Additional file 2: Table S1) to explore and validate the association of mutations in mTOR pathway genes with survival of patients treated with ICI. The patients’ characteristics were presented in Additional file 2: Tables S2, S3. We found that compared with the PGDx elio Tissue Complete and Foundation One NGS panel, the MSK-IMPACT panel had the most genes involved in mTOR pathway. We identified 23 mTOR pathway genes (Additional file 2: Table S4) with available mutation information in 1661 patients from MSKCC study of TMB and immunology. By incorporating mutations in these genes in stepwise Cox regression, we further identified 8 genes, including FGFR2, PIK3C3, FGFR4, FGFR1, FGF3, AKT1, mTOR, and RPTOR, that fitted an optimal survival model for patients treated with ICI (Fig. 2A). The stepwise Cox analysis considered both forward and backward direction and resulted in decreased akaike information criterion (AIC) and variables as the increase in iteration (Fig. 2B). Of note, the 8 genes were found to be located at the key position of the mTOR pathway, including the ligand and receptor, and genes involved in midstream phosphorylase kinase (Fig. 2C). We next asked the survival association of mutation states for this 8-gene signature by integrated analysis. We observed prolonged survival by mutations of this 8-gene signature in mTOR pathway, with death risk decreased by 36% (HR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.50–0.83, P = 5.17 × 10–4) upon multivariate adjustment for age, sex, TMB, and treatment (Fig. 2D). Because of unmet assumptions for Cox model, we used RMST method and successfully validated this survival association in other 553 patients from 6 published trials who received ICI (LER = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.08–2.70, P = 0.023, Fig. 2F). In 2244 patients who did not receive ICI in the MSKCC study, we did not find any association between the mutations and patients’ survival (Fig. 2E). The lack of survival prediction for patients with non-ICI treatment was also validated in 763 advanced cancer patients from TCGA (Fig. 2G), indicating the specific predictive ability of the mutations in mTOR pathway genes for ICI treatment efficacy.\n\nIdentification of mTOR pathway genes and two-stage survival analysis in cancer patients with ICI treatment. In discovery stage of 1661 ICI-treated cancer patients from TMB and immunotherapy study by MSKCC, we performed stepwise Cox regression with both direction of backward and forward using 23 mTOR pathway genes, which further yielded 8 genes upon iteration, including FGFR2, PIK3C3, FGFR4, FGFR1, FGF3, AKT1, mTOR, and RPTOR (A). The AIC and variables left for each step during stepwise Cox regression (B). The biological role of the 8 genes, which were marked red, in mTOR pathway (C). Mutation states of the 8-gene signature for the 1661 ICI treated patients were used for integrated survival comparison by Kaplan–Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression with adjustment for age, gender, treatment and TMB (D). The survival association was also tested in 2244 patients without ICI treatment (E). Using RMST analysis, the survival association were validated in 553 ICI-treated patients from other 6 independent cohorts and 763 patients without ICI treatment from TCGA (F, G)\nMutation frequency, types, and distribution across cancer types\nUsing 44,078 cancer patients from 188 non-redundant studies deposited in cbioportal database, we found that the mutant frequency for the 8 genes ranged from 1.5 to 3% (Fig. 3A). Endometrial cancer had the leading mutation frequency by integrated analysis of the 8-gene signature in mTOR pathway, followed by breast cancer and melanoma (Fig. 3B). By analysis of MAF files of TCGA pan-cancer mutations, we found that most of them displayed significant co-mutation (Fig. 3C).\n\nMutation frequency and distribution across cancer types. The mutant frequency for the 8 genes using 44,078 cancer patients from 188 non-redundant cancer studies deposited in cbioportal database (A). The integrated mutation frequency for the 8 genes across multiple cancer types (B). The mutation exclusive pattern of the 8 genes by analysis of the TCGA MAF files (C)\nMutation types and survival\nIn both discovery (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A, B) and validation (Additional file 1: Fig. S1C, D), we found that the impact of mTOR pathway mutations on better survival of patients with ICI treatment was mainly attributed to the missense mutations, and we did not find any association of other mutations with patients’ survival. We also visualized the multivariate results in forest plot, in order to present the impact of overall, missense and other mutations, respectively, on patients’ survival upon ICI treatment (Additional file 1: Fig. S1E, F).\nInteraction with TMB and survival\nMutations in the 8-gene signature was found to be associated with increased TMB in 5646 patients from the MSKCC cohort (Fig. 4A), which was further demonstrated in 10,163 patients from TCGA database (Fig. 4B). To explain the potential reason, we questioned whether there was a correlation between the mutations in mTOR pathway and DDR pathway. As a result, in both MSKCC and TCGA cohort, we found that the mutation frequency of most genes involved in DDR pathway were up-regulated in presence of mutations in the 8-gene signature in mTOR pathway (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Specially, these up-regulations were involved in DNA double-strand breaks repair (DSBR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and base excision repair (BER), including ATM, ERCC3 and 4, and BRCA1 and 2 genes, indicating that the abnormal DNA repair might be the inducement to the increased TMB in the patients with mutant-type signature in mTOR pathway (Additional file 2: Tables S5, S6). In MSKCC study, we found that TMB classification did not influence the trend towards better survival for mutant-type patients with adjustment for age, gender, TMB and treatment (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.47–0.96, P = 0.028 for low-TMB patients, Fig. 4C; and HR = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.48–0.92, P = 0.013 for high-TMB patients, Fig. 4D). Using multivariate RMST analysis, we observed similar trend with borderline significance in the validation (Fig. 4E, F). We also calculated adjusted RMST results in discovery for polling with validation using meta-analysis method. Polling results demonstrated a better survival in presence of mTOR pathway mutations in low-TMB patients (Fig. 4G). In high-TMB patients, the results achieved a borderline trend similar to that in discovery (Fig. 4H). Because there are limited patients with available treatment response data, we also combined the samples in the two stages to extract the response data and found that mutant-type patients had higher treatment response rate as well as DCB rate compared with wild-type patients (Fig. 4I, J).\n\nInteraction with TMB and survival. The association of the mutations in the 8-gene signature with TMB in 5646 patients from MSKCC study (A) and the validation in 10,163 patients from TCGA database (B). In discovery stage of 1661 ICI-treated patients, we showed the survival comparison of mutant-type versus wild-type patients in presence of low TMB (n = 1173, C) and high TMB (n = 488, D) by Kapan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression. The survival interaction with TMB were further validated in validation stage of 327 low-TMB (E) and 155 high-TMB patients (F) by Kapan-Meier curves and multivariate RMST analysis. To alleviate the limited statistical power induced by subgroup stratification, we pooled the adjusted RMST results of the two stages using meta-analysis method in low-TMB patients (G) and high-TMB patients (H). We also combined the available samples in the two stages to associate the mutation states of the 8-gene signature with treatment response rate (I) and DCB rate (J)\nMutations and the activation status of mTOR pathway\nThe common target genes of mTOR pathway were shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3A. We observed up-regulation in mRNA expression of EIF4E (EIF4EBP1), AKT1, HIF-1a (mRNA transcription effector of mTOR pathway), S6K (RPS6KA1 and RPS6KB1), but down-regulation in PKC (PRKCA), SGK1, TFEB and ULK1 by the mTOR pathway mutations (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B). Although most have direction towards the activation of mTOR pathway, the deep regulation in protein function, phosphorylation modification for example, are still unclear.\nImmunological phenotype and mechanism\nUsing transcriptome data extracted from TCGA, we found that mutations in the 8-gene signature in mTOR pathway induced higher overall immune cells infiltration, T cells infiltration, antigen presentation, and neoantigen production (Fig. 5A). Specially, we observed the increased infiltration of CD8 + T cells, activated B (plasma) cells, activated mast cells, activated CD4 + memory T cells, M1 macrophages, but decreased M2 macrophages (Fig. 5C). Further TCGA analysis also resulted in the tendency towards up-regulation in mutant-type patients for the mRNA expression involved in different immune phenotype (Fig. 5B), especially for chemokines (Fig. 5D) and immune checkpoints (Fig. 5E), including PD1 and PDL1 (also termed CD274, Fig. 5E) that were closely associated with immune cells recruitment and ICI treatment efficacy. To reveal the potential mechanism underlying our observation in TCGA, we performed pathway enrichment analysis using GSEA method. There was an obvious immune pathway enrichment, such as T cell receptor signaling, NK cell mediated cytotoxicity, antigen presentation (Fig. 6A, B), and interferon response pathway (Fig. 6B), in the comparison of mutant-type versus wild-type patients. As expected, the mTORC1 and metabolism pathway was also enriched (Fig. 6B), because of the function in metabolism reprogramming by mTOR pathway mutation. DNA repair and protein folding, two pathways that caused production of neoantigen, were also enriched by the signature mutation in mTOR pathway (Fig. 6A, B). We repeated the GSEA analysis in transcriptome data from IMvigor210 clinical trial, and validated the enriched pathways mainly overlapped in immunology (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). The results for GSEA analysis in TCGA and IMvigor210 in detail were presented in Additional file 2: Tables S7 and S8, respectively. Taken together, our observations provided the clues for the association between mTOR pathway mutations and “hot” microenvironment in tumors (Fig. 6C). We finally exemplified an 82-year-old patient with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma in our center, who had AKT1 mutation in the tumor and good response to pembrolizumab. The tumor has shrunk by approximately two thirds after 2 cycle treatment of 200 mg pembrolizumab (Additional file 1: Fig. S5).\n\nmTOR pathway mutations and immunological phenotype. The association of mutations in the 8-gene signature involved in mTOR pathway with overall immune cells infiltration, T cells infiltration, antigen presentation, and neoantigen production (A). A heatmap showed the fold changes of mRNA expression involved in different immune phenotype in the comparison of mutant-type versus wild-type patients (B). Specially, we showed the association of the mTOR pathway mutations with expression of chemokines (D) and immune checkpoints genes including PD1 and PDL1 (also termed CD274) (E) that were closely associated with ICI treatment efficacy. We also observed the change of immune cells infiltration induced by mTOR pathway mutations (C); **, < 0.01, ***, < 0.001\n\nmTOR pathway mutations and pathway enrichment analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis from TCGA database using GSEA method, in the comparison of mutant-type versus wild-type patients for the 8-gene signature involved in mTOR pathway. We showed representative pathway enrichment involved in immunity, DNA repair, and protein folding (A). All pathways enriched was summarized in one figure (B). Our association analysis of survival, immune phenotype, and potential mechanisms demonstrated the switch from immunologically “cold” to “hot” microenvironment in tumors in presence of the 8-gene signature involved in mTOR pathway (C)\nMutations in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and ICI treatment\nBlood-based NGS was performed in OAK and POPLAR trial with comparison of ICI treatment versus chemotherapy, which was extracted for the association analysis between the mTOR mutations and ICI treatment response. We identified 853 patients with cfDNA mutation data, of which 424 patients received docetaxel and 429 patients received atezolizumab. Among these patients, 157 had mutations in the 8-gene signature in mTOR pathways, including 85 patients treated with docetaxel and 72 patients treated with atezolizumab. We did not find any significant association of the mutations in mTOR pathway signature with efficacy of atezolizumab treatment (data not shown). However, compared with docetaxel, we found that mutant-type patients had prolonged overall survival (OS) (Additional file 1: Fig. S6A), progression-free survival (PFS) (Additional file 1: Fig. S6B), and increased ORR and DCB (Additional file 1: Fig. S6C, D) in the comparison of atezolizumab versus docetaxel treatment. In the subgroup analysis by TMB, survival remained favorable in mutant-type patients treated with atezolizumab in comparison with docetaxel (Additional file 1: Fig. S7), except for PFS in high-TMB patients that only reached insignificant trend in multivariate RMST analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S7D).\nDiscussion\nGenetic mutations [29, 30], transcriptomic signature [31] and DNA methylation [32] were previously reported to be associated with sensitivity and resistance to ICI treatment. In the present study, we have reported that mutations in mTOR pathway, a classical modulator in cancer cell metabolism and cancer malignancy, were predictable for ICI treatment outcome. mTOR pathway induces the metabolism switch needed for immune activation [12]. Indeed, in presence of mTOR pathway mutations, we observed pathway enrichment involved in anti-tumor immunity in tumors, as well as enhanced antigen presentation and increased infiltration in immune effector cells.\nThere were some previous studies exploring the association between mTOR pathway mutations and ICI treatment. One multi-omics study demonstrated that mTOR and PI3K-AKI axis were involved in gastric cancer immunity, and the related mutations were associated with better survival of patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy [33]. In another study, it was reported that PIK3CA gene mutation was associated with immunity in bladder cancer, and its inhibitor increased the sensitivity to PD1 blockade for mutant-type patients [34]. Intriguingly, like our studies, it was previously reported that the AKT-MTOR axis mutation was able to upregulate immune checkpoints [14], including PDL1, a widely used biomarker that sensitize the ICI treatment in a series of studies. In the present study, we develop and validate the role of the mutations in mTOR pathway genes, including FGFR2, PIK3C3, FGFR4, FGFR1, FGF3, AKT1, mTOR, and RPTOR, in ICI treatment response. Not surprisingly, these 8 genes were all located at the key node of the mTOR pathway and are indispensable for the downstream activation, providing the ration for their association with ICI treatment. Collectively, mTOR pathway mutations are obviously involved in cancer immunity, and affect the sensitivity to ICI treatment.\nOf note, we observed that mutations in mTOR pathway genes were positively associated with DDR pathway mutations. We also found the enrichment in DNA repair pathway by mTOR pathway mutation in tumors. In previous studies, mTOR pathway was reportedly to be interacted with DDR, including DNA repair pathway [35, 36]. The link of mTOR pathway with DDR pathway provided another mechanism underlying the predictive ability of mTOR pathway mutation for ICI treatment response, because DNA repair pathways plays a role in TMB accumulation and neoantigen production, thus they were previously demonstrated to be associated with sensitivity of ICI treatment [37]. Another finding in the present study is also rational that mTOR pathway mutation was associated with increased TMB, likely due to its close relationship with DNA repair processing.\nIntriguingly, the stratification analysis suggested that the missense mutations contributed mainly to the better survival for patients with ICI treatment. Because missense mutations may render the protein function, this finding is biological reasonable. Indeed, our further analysis also suggested that the mTOR pathway mutations regulated the mRNA expression in the target genes, but we could not draw a clear conclusion for its impact on the activation status of mTOR pathway due to the lack of protein modification results. However, these results provided some new clues for the involvement of mTOR pathway in ICI treatment. Interaction with TMB was another concern of the findings in the present study. High TMB in cancer tissues was an indicator for sensitive response to ICI treatment as reported by recent studies [10, 38]. Although we observed higher TMB in presence of the mutations in mTOR pathway, TMB had minimal impact on the association between mTOR pathway mutations and ICI treatment sensitivity. Therefore, mutations in this 8-gene signature in mTOR pathway may be used in clinical practice, independent of TMB, to predictive the sensitivity of ICI treatment. Not only TMB in tumor tissues, but also the blood TMB also played a role in ICI treatment efficacy [28, 39]. However, unlike tumor mutation, we did not find any association between cfDNA mutations in mTOR pathway and response to ICI treatment. The results suggest that tumor mutation, not the cfDNA mutation in mTOR pathway, mainly contribute to the immune stimuli in tumor micro-environment and promote the ICI treatment sensitivity in turn.\nResearches in recent decades has led to rapid advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers [40, 41]. mTOR pathway plays multiple roles in cancer biology that may provides insights into cancer therapy, not limited to ICI treatment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, an important component in cell metabolism, may activate oncogenic pathways, including ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways that promote the proliferation and migration of cancer cells [42–44]. Therefore, antioxidant therapy is possible to exert anti-cancer efficiency by dampening ROS production [45]. Autophagy links the mTOR pathway to ROS formation. Of note, authophay induced by mTORC1 suppression in cancer cells may result in degradation of damaged mitochondria that promote the ROS formation and oxidative stress, which is also called mitophagy [46, 47]. Moreover, the activation of mTORC1 suppress cell authophagy in response to increased ROS formation [46]. Taken together, antioxidant therapy is expected to be used in cancer treatment, which may result in different anti-cancer efficacy based on the mTOR pathway activation status. Whether mTOR pathway mutations affect the antioxidant therapy in cancers is to be answered in future investigations.\nThere are some limitations in the present study. First, the retrospective design in data collection may introduce bias in the present study. Second, the subgroup analysis based on TMB decrease the statistical power to some extent. Third, this is a pan-cancer study, but not all types of cancer are included.\nIn summary, we demonstrated that mutations in an 8-gene signature in mTOR pathway might promote the ICI treatment sensitivity, which was independent of TMB. As a potential mechanism underlying this association, these mutations were likely to have association with enhanced anti-tumor immunity by increased infiltration of immune effector cells. Larger studies are warranted to validate our findings.\nSupplementary Information\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1. Mutation types of mTOR pathway and survival of patients with ICI treatment.

The mTOR pathway is often aberrantly activated in cancers. While hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and DNA damage restrain mTORC1 activity, multiple genetic events constitutively activate mTOR in cancers. Here we provide a brief overview of the signaling pathways up- and downstream of mTORC1 and -2, and discuss the insights into therapeutic anticancer targets — both those that have been tried in the clinic with limited success and those currently under clinical development — that knowledge of these pathways gives us.\nBasics of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling network\nMammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and member of the PI3K-related kinase (PIKK) family, which includes PI3K, DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK), and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). mTOR is a master integrator of signals governing protein and lipid biosynthesis and growth factor–driven cell cycle progression (Figure 1). It functions to regulate these processes in two cellular complexes. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) includes mTOR regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), mLST8, and proline-rich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) (1) and is allosterically inhibited by the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin (2). Rapamycin binds irreversibly to mTORC1 and impairs substrate recruitment. mTOR forms a second complex, mTORC2, with rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor), mLST8, and stress-activated MAPK-interacting protein 1 (Sin1) (3). Although rapamycin does not directly inhibit mTORC2, in U937 lymphoma cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, and PC3 xenografts, prolonged rapamycin treatment inhibits mTORC2 action, likely via irreversible mTOR sequestration (4). While most mTORC1 and -2 components differ, DEP domain–containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) binds and inhibits both complexes. Upregulation of DEPTOR expression or activity may present a novel therapeutic strategy for mTOR kinase inhibition (5).\n         \nFigure 1. Targeting the mTOR signaling network for cancer therapy.\n\nmTOR-based targeting strategies are presented in the context of the PI3K/mTOR signaling network. Pathways activating mTOR via RTKs and PI3K are shown together with effectors regulating protein and lipid biosynthesis and cell cycle. mTORC1 and mTORC2 modulate cell cycle via effects on Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27, cyclin D1, and cyclin E; SREBPs and ACL regulate lipid biosynthesis downstream of AKT; mTORC1 phosphorylates 4EBP1 and S6K1 to activate critical drivers of global protein translation. Also represented are important feedback pathways whereby mTORC1 reduces signaling through PI3K and mTORC2: S6K1 phosphorylates IRS1, promoting its proteolysis; S6K1 phosphorylates Rictor to inhibit mTORC2-dependent AKT activation. The TSC1/2 complex serves as a relay center for tumor microenvironmental queues. Oncogenic PI3K/PDK1 and Ras/MAPK signaling cooperate to reduce TSC1/2 activity. Hypoxia (via HIF1α), DNA damage (via p53), and nutrient deprivation (via LKB1) all activate TSC1/2 to restrain mTORC1 and biosynthetic processes in normal tissue. These pathways are often inactivated during tumorigenesis. Rapalogs are mTORC1-specific inhibitors. TOR-KIs more potently inhibit both mTOR complexes. Dual PI3K/TOR-KIs additionally block upstream signaling via PI3K. Green circles represent stimulatory phosphorylations; red circles, inhibitory phosphorylations.\nmTOR activity is intricately linked to PI3K signaling (Figure 1 and refs. 6, 7). Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) for IGF-1, HGF, and EGF all signal through PI3K to activate phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase–1 (PDK1). In turn, PDK1 phosphorylates AGC family kinases (homologs of protein kinases A, G, and C), including AKT, serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), and ribosomal S6 kinase, 90 kDa, polypeptide 1 (RSK1), all of which require a second stimulatory phosphorylation to become activated. mTORC2 mediates this second phosphorylation on AKT (8, 9); both mTORC1 and mTORC2 can do so for SGK1 (10, 11); and MAPK1 and MAPK3 both do so for RSK1 (12). Thus, PI3K and mTOR pathways act together to promote cell growth, division, and survival: AKT activates antiapoptotic mechanisms and the cell cycle; SGK1 regulates insulin and energy metabolism; and RSK1 activates mitogenic transcription factors (12–14).\n         \nThe tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)/TSC2 complex inhibits mTOR/Raptor by keeping the mTORC1 activator Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) in its inactive state (1, 15). Importantly, AKT is not only a substrate of mTORC2, but also indirectly activates mTORC1 by phosphorylating and inhibiting TSC2 (16–18). TSC1/2 functions as a molecular hub, integrating growth factor and energy-sensing pathways to regulate mTOR/Raptor activity (Figure 1). Mitogens inactivate TSC1/2 via ERK-, AKT-, and RSK1-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2, to drive mTORC1-dependent protein and lipid biosynthesis (17, 19–21). RSK1 also phosphorylates and activates Raptor (22).\n         \nIn normal tissues, TSC1/2 is activated by adverse conditions such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and nutrient deprivation to inhibit mTORC1-mediated biosynthetic processes when substrate availability is limited. Hypoxia, via HIF1α, activates REDD1, which antagonizes AKT-mediated TSC2 inactivation (23–25). Nutrient deprivation activates LKB1, which drives AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to phosphorylate and activate TSC2 (26–28). DNA damage also activates AMPK via the tumor suppressor p53 (29). AMPK can also phosphorylate Raptor, leading to its sequestration by 14-3-3 (30). Thus, DNA damage and energy stress drive AMPK to activate TSC1/2 and inhibit mTORC1 via multiple mechanisms.\n         \nThe intricate regulation of TSC1/2 highlights the importance of mTORC1 in cellular homeostasis. mTORC1 stimulates protein biosynthesis by phosphorylating ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) to activate ribosomal biogenesis and by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1 (4EBP1), thereby activating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to promote protein translation (31). mTOR also stimulates lipid biogenesis, which is required for both membrane synthesis and modification of mitogenic signal transducers (32). While mTORC1 is best understood for its role in the activation of protein biosynthesis, both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activate cell cycle progression via the AGC kinases (reviewed in refs. 33, 34, and see Figure 1). mTORC2, via AKT, increases cyclin D1 transcription and translation, and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase–3-β–mediated (GSK3-β–mediated) cyclin D1 and cyclin E proteolysis (33, 35). AKT phosphorylates the forkhead transcription factor AFX to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) transcription (36). AKT also phosphorylates the Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27 to impair their actions (33, 37).\n         \nHere we review how investigation of this complex mTOR signaling network has revealed important mechanisms contributing to human tumorigenesis and stimulated development of mTOR-targeted anticancer therapies. Despite the limited clinical success of the first-generation drugs, rapamycin and its analogs (which are known as rapalogs), biological insights into molecular signaling arising from their use have informed pharmacological design of second-generation drugs that target mTOR kinase activity, the mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs).\nmTOR signaling in cancer\nCrosstalk among mTORC1, mTORC2, and PI3K normally ensures an elegant balance between cell growth and division (Figure 1). Given this, it is perhaps not surprising that disruption, either up- or downstream of mTOR, is seen in many tumor types.\n         \nUpstream of mTOR in cancer.\nAberrant PI3K/mTOR activation is commonly observed in cancers (7) and can result from amplification of, or activating mutations in, genes encoding the upstream RTKs, components of PI3K, or effector kinases (38). PIK3CA, which encodes the catalytic p110α subunit of PI3K, is the most frequently mutated kinase in human cancer (39). Moreover, the gene encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which normally restrains PI3K activity, is frequently deleted or inactivated (7). RSK1 hyperactivation due to RTK-dependent oncogenic Ras/MAPK and PI3K/PDK1 pathway activation is also observed in cancers (40).\n            \nIn tumors, the TSC1/2-activating pathways discussed above (in “Basics of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling network”) are often disrupted (41): inactivating mutations of the P53 and LKB1 tumor suppressor–encoding genes are common, while angiogenesis and re-oxygenation reduce signaling via HIF1α and REDD1. Heritable mutations affecting either TSC1 or TSC2 give rise to tuberous sclerosis syndrome, which is characterized by multiple benign tumors, including angiofibroma of the skin, lymphangioleiomyoma of the lungs, renal angiomyolipoma, and astrocytomas of the brain (41). While TSC1 and TSC2 mutations are rare in sporadic human cancers (42–44), reduced TSC1 or TSC2 levels have been observed (45–48). Mutational inactivation of another tumor suppressor, neuro­fibromatosis 1 (NF1), which encodes a Ras-GAP, upregulates Ras-GTP levels leading to activation of MEK/MAPK and RSK1, which in turn inactivates TSC1/2 (49). Finally, oncogenic MEK/MAPK activation by BRAF in melanoma was recently shown to inhibit LKB1 binding to AMPK1 and thereby AMPK1 activation (50, 51). All of these events impair the ability of the TSC1/TSC2 complex to inhibit mTOR/Raptor in response to nutrient and oxygen deprivation and DNA damage, resulting in mTORC1 hyperactivation.\n            \nThe different genetic lesions that mediate mTORC1 activation in cancer have different consequences: PTEN loss uncouples mTORC1 activation from growth factor signaling (i.e., PI3K/MAPK signaling), leaving bioenergetic sensing via LKB1 and AMPK intact (52); LKB1 mutations permit mTORC1 activation despite nutrient deprivation in poorly vascularized tumors; and P53 mutations uncouple DNA damage from the inhibition of bioenergetic processes and cell cycle arrest.\n            \nmTOR studies have also revealed a new link between obesity and increased cancer risk. Data from experimental animals and humans show that mTORC1 is activated by a high-fat diet (53) and by branched-chain amino acids present in obese individuals (54). Interestingly, metformin, an oral hypoglycemic agent used to treat type 2 diabetes, was recently shown to activate AMPK via LKB1 (55). It has therefore been suggested that metformin may have anticancer effects via AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inhibition (56). A recent phase I trial of metformin with temsirolimus demonstrated disease stabilization (57), and clinical trials combining metformin with newer TOR-KIs warrant consideration.\n            \nDownstream of mTOR in cancer.\nmTOR drives cancer growth by activating the lipid and protein biosynthesis needed for robust tumor expansion. This occurs via deregulated signal transduction and the resulting hyperactivation of the critical mTORC1 effectors S6K1 and eIF4E. Oncogenic mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation also drives cell proliferation via increases in cyclin D1 and cyclin E and loss of the restraining effects of p21 and p27 on cell cycle as noted above. Recent work links oncogenic PI3K/mTOR activation with cancer cell motility via p27. AKT, SGK1, and RSK1 cooperate to phosphorylate p27 at T157 and T198, which impairs nuclear p27 import (10, 58–62), causing cytoplasmic p27 to accumulate in cancer cells and bind RhoA (63). This inhibits RhoA-ROCK1, causing actin cytoskeleton destabilization and increased cell motility and metastasis (63–65). SGK action on p27 may underlie the observation that SGK3, a kinase closely related to SGK1, promotes anchorage-independent tumor growth (66). While the normal physiologic role for this is not clear, in cancers, constitutive PI3K/mTOR mis­localizes p27 to cytoplasm, thereby reducing Cdk inhibition by p27, and increases p27-RhoA binding to enhance tumor metastasis.\n            \nRapamycin and rapalogs as anticancer therapies\nBiologic investigation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling network has complemented the identification of genetic mutations in specific cancers to inform the development of clinical therapies targeting the network. Initial observations of network activation in human tumors led to the preclinical and clinical development of rapamycin and its analogs — allosteric, irreversible inhibitors of Raptor-bound mTOR — as anticancer therapies. Their investigation as anticancer therapies was aided by the fact that rapamycin had been FDA approved for many years as an immunosuppressant to prevent organ transplant rejection, and was well tolerated, despite the importance of mTORC1 in cellular homeostasis (67–69).\n         \nRapalogs: preclinical and clinical trials.\nClinical trials are currently underway to test the efficacy of rapamycin and several rapalogs, including temsirolimus (Torisel, CCI-779, Pfizer), everolimus (RAD001, Novartis), and ridaforolimus (AP23573, Ariad Pharmaceuticals), as anticancer therapies (ref. 70 and Table 1). By late 2010, the U.S. NCI website ClinicalTrials.gov listed more than 160 mTOR-directed clinical trials underway. In a large, multicenter phase III trial, temsirolimus prolonged overall survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) compared with other treatments (71), leading to FDA approval of temsirolimus in 2007 for metastatic RCC. This study validated mTOR as a therapeutic target in cancer. Everolimus also showed efficacy in a placebo-controlled phase III trial in RCC (72) and was FDA approved in 2009.\n            \nRapalogs: clinical development status\n\nRapalogs have shown promise in several other malignancies that are often refractory to standard chemotherapies. Temsirolimus yielded a 22% overall response rate (ORR, which represents complete or partial responses divided by the number of patients treated) in a phase III trial for refractory mantle cell lymphoma, in contrast to only 2% for investigator’s choice of therapy (73). Similarly, rapalogs showed single-agent activity against other types of lymphomas (74–76) and are being evaluated in phase II trials for sarcomas, endometrial cancers, and other advanced solid tumors (77–79). For example, a recent phase I study of everolimus showed promise in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (80).\n            \nNot surprisingly, rapalogs have shown efficacy against proliferative syndromes resulting from mutational inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2. Various studies in TSC patients showed that rapalogs improve facial angiofibroma, renal angiomyolipoma, and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (81–83), and further trials are underway. Substantial regression of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas was observed with rapamycin in a phase I trial in TSC patients (84). This was followed by a phase II trial of everolimus for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas that showed reduction in seizures and tumor size (85). These striking results provide perhaps the strongest proof of concept that mTOR inhibitors will work in selected patients whose tumors are driven by mTOR signaling abnormalities.\n            \nDespite frequent PTEN loss in sporadic glioma and melanoma, rapalogs have had little efficacy in patients with these tumors (86, 87). In endometrial cancers, which have early PTEN loss, tumor regression has rarely been observed, despite stabilization of disease by rapalogs in 26%–44% of those treated in two small phase II studies (78, 79). Moreover, while breast cancers show frequent PI3K activation (7), via HER2 amplification, overexpression of IGF-1R or EGFR, PIK3CA mutation, or PTEN loss, the activity of temsirolimus (ORR, 7%–10%) (88) and everolimus (ORR, 12%) (89) as single-agent therapies was disappointing in individuals with metastatic breast cancer.\n            \nThus, while rapalogs have demonstrated some success, they have shown only modest efficacy in tumors where they were expected to provide substantial benefit. The clinical successes, notably for RCC and mantle cell lymphoma, are meaningful, since these diseases are largely resistant to standard chemotherapy. Benign tumors arising from TSC1 and TSC2 mutations may be most sensitive to rapalogs because of their greater inherent genetic stability and a lower propensity for activation of resistance mechanisms. Perhaps the most significant success of the laboratory and clinical investigation of rapalogs in cancers is that they have revealed potential causes of rapalog failure, which fostered the development of next-generation TOR-KIs.\n            \nMechanisms underlying the limited anticancer efficacy of rapalogs.\nBoth animal and clinical studies have shown that rapalogs are primarily cytostatic, not cytotoxic, and clinical efficacy largely reflects disease stabilization rather than regression (70). One reason for rapalog failure is that they are incomplete, substrate-selective mTORC1 inhibitors: rapalogs block the action of mTORC1 on certain substrates more effectively and more durably than others. For example, although rapamycin and its analogs inhibit S6K1 phosphorylation, they show only transient or no ability to block 4EBP1 phosphorylation and cap-dependent translation (90–92). The molecular mechanisms underlying this are not well understood. Thus, rapalogs only incompletely inhibit mTORC1-dependent protein synthesis, and this may contribute to resistance to rapalogs.\n            \nRapalogs, through irreversible sequestration of mTOR, disrupt a dynamic signaling network linking mitogen and energy sensing. Another reason for rapalog failure is the existence of feedback circuits, activated by mTORC1 inhibition, that drive mitogenic signaling. For example, mTORC1 inhibition leads to feedback activation of the PI3K pathway. In normal cells, autoinhibitory feedback mechanisms limit mTORC1 and -2 signaling (Figure 1). mTORC1 activates S6K1, which promotes insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteolysis (93). The IRS scaffold protein facilitates insulin and IGF receptor signaling to activate PI3K. mTORC1- and S6K1-mediated IRS loss dampens PI3K signaling, which in turn reduces input to mTORC1. Rapalogs block this S6K1-dependent autoinhibitory pathway (93), causing feedback activation of PI3K, promoting resistance to the effects of rapamycin and its analogs. Following everolimus treatment, biopsy specimens showed AKT activation in colon cancers (94). Rapalog-sensitive feedback mechanisms also activate other RTKs through additional scaffold proteins (95, 96).\n            \nAnother feedback circuit exists in which mTORC1 activity, functioning via S6K1, leads to phosphorylation of Rictor to inhibit mTORC2 (97, 98). Rapalog-mediated mTORC1 inhibition relieves this tonic Rictor inhibition and drives mTORC2-mediated AKT activation. In addition, mTORC1 inhibition can cause feedback activation of MAPK via an S6K1/PI3K/Ras pathway. Consistent with this, MAPK activation has been observed in metastatic solid tumors following RAD001 treatment (99). Thus, the cytostatic effects of rapalogs in cancers are limited by feedback activation of PI3K, Ras/MAPK, mTORC2, and downstream AGC kinases, all of which oppose rapalog effects on protein biosynthesis and cell cycle.\n            \nCombinations targeting upstream activators to enhance rapalog efficacy.\nThe modest clinical results of single-agent rapalog trials, with disease stabilization rather than regression being achieved, have prompted a number of combination therapy trials (Table 1). Rapalogs have shown in vitro synergism with several cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (100, 101). While rapalog/chemotherapeutic combination trials may have had little molecular rationale at their inception, recent work has provided one. p53-deficient cancers have lost a major mechanism by which DNA damage leads to mTORC1 inhibition. In normal cells, DNA damage activates AMPK via p53, and AMPK-driven TSC1/2 activation inhibits mTORC1 to permit DNA repair before cell division (29). Cells with p53 loss no longer respond to chemotherapeutic DNA damage by attenuating mTORC1 activity and arresting proliferation. This allows continued cell division despite significant DNA damage, rendering cells more sensitive to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Cell survival becomes mTORC1 dependent, rendering cancer cells more sensitive to combined chemo-/rapalog therapy.\n            \nTrials are underway to enhance rapalog efficacy and overcome feedback PI3K activation by combining rapalogs with antitumor agents acting upstream of mTORC1 (Table 1). Everolimus is being evaluated with a somatostatin analog, octreotide, that blocks IGF production and consequent PI3K activation. A phase II trial of everolimus and octreotide for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors yielded an ORR of 20%, a dramatic improvement over everolimus alone (102), and a phase III registration trial is now underway (Table 1). In non–small cell lung cancer, where EGFR inhibitors have modest efficacy, combinations of rapalogs with erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are under investigation in phase II trials. Estrogen is known to stimulate both MAPK and PI3K, both of which contribute to mTORC1/2 activation (103). In preclinical breast cancer studies, rapalogs augmented effects of anti-estrogens, including tamoxifen, fulvestrant, and aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and exemestane) (104–106). It is not clear why combined temsirolimus and letrozole yielded no improvement over letrozole alone in one trial in metastatic estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancer (107), while everolimus appeared to complement letrozole in advanced breast cancer (108, 109). Combined aromatase and mTORC1 inhibition is being further evaluated in larger patient cohorts. Strategies combining exemestane with everolimus have been promising, as has combining HER2 blockade by trastuzumab and everolimus in HER2+ breast cancer in early clinical studies (110).\n            \nPerhaps the greatest therapeutic efficacy of rapalogs and the TOR-KIs will lie in their rational combination with drugs that block nodal pathways in cancer signaling and preclude feedback pathway activation, such as inhibitors of EGFR1/2, IGF-1R, PI3K, BRAF, and MEK. For example, since BRAF is frequently activated in melanoma (111), the ensuing MEK activation blocks LBK1/AMPK-driven TSC1/2 activation and keeps mTORC1 constitutively active (50, 51). Thus, rapalog/BRAF inhibitor combinations may prove beneficial for this tumor type. While such strategies may ultimately yield viable treatment options, dose-limiting rapalog toxicities, including skin rash, nausea, and diarrhea, may be manifest in combination with other drugs. This potential limitation and the more concerning observations that rapalogs cause only incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 signaling and lead to the unintended activation of feedback loops that drive PI3K, mTORC2, and MEK signaling have therefore stimulated a shift in drug development toward next-generation TOR-KIs and dual PI3K/mTOR catalytic site inhibitors (PI3K/TOR-KIs).\n\n            \nBeyond rapalogs: molecular rationale and new therapeutic strategies\nThe promise of TOR-KIs and PI3K/TOR-KIs.\nThe recognition that rapalogs have limited substrate-specific efficacy and cause feedback activation of several oncogenic pathways has fueled the development of TOR-KIs and PI3K/TOR-KIs. Several of these are currently in phase I/II trials (Tables 2 and 3) or in preclinical development with lead compound optimization underway. mTOR catalytic inhibitors, via inhibition of mTORC2, prevent feedback-mediated AKT activation that results from inhibition of only mTORC1. In addition to circumventing this consequence of rapalog-mediated PI3K activation, several other mechanisms underlie the greater potential efficacy of these newer agents.\n            \nTOR-KI clinical development status\n\nPI3K/TOR-KI clinical development status\n\nTOR-KIs cause more potent and durable inhibition of mTORC1 than rapalogs and hence more effectively inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanistic reasons for this are unclear. In a majority of cancer lines, rapalogs fail to inhibit protein synthesis due to weak or only transient inhibition of mTORC1-mediated 4EBP1 phosphorylation (92). TOR-KIs, including WYE354 and WYE132 (Pfizer) (112), PP30 and PP242 (INK-128, Intellikine) (91), AZD8055 (AstraZeneca) (113), and Torin 1 (114), all inhibit protein synthesis with greater potency, due in part to greater inhibition of mTORC1 action on 4EBP1. Potential contributions of mTORC2 to protein synthesis via AKT/GSK3-β and PKC are also obviated by these drugs.\n            \nMost cancers show strong activation of glycolysis, which contributes to cell survival in hypoxic and energy-poor environments. This shift to glycolytic over oxidative metabolism is mediated in part through AKT-dependent activation of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). Lactate accumulation and acidosis activate HIF1α and HIF2α, which drive transcription of glycolytic regulators (115, 116). TOR-KIs may more strongly oppose glycolysis than rapamycin (112) due to the lack of feedback activation of PI3K-driven AKT and due to their direct inhibition of mTORC2 leading to loss of AKT-dependent Glut1 accumulation. This may contribute importantly to the greater antitumor effects demonstrated in xenograft tumors treated with these compounds (112).\n            \nThe increase in biomass of any malignant tumor requires lipid biosynthesis for cell membrane synthesis and lipid-based energy metabolism. In addition, many lipid-modified molecules regulate cellular signaling. It has recently come to light that GSK3-β–mediated phosphorylation targets for degradation a class of lipogenic transcription factors known as sterol-responsive element–binding proteins (SREBPs) (117, 118). PI3K/mTORC2-mediated AKT activation, by inhibiting GSK3-β, stabilizes the SREBPs to promote lipogenesis. In addition, ATP citrate lyase (ACL), a critical regulator of fatty acid synthesis, is phosphorylated and activated by AKT (119, 120). TOR-KIs and PI3K/TOR-KIs would thus, through their more potent inhibition of AKT than rapalogs, oppose lipid biosynthetic processes contributing to the selective loss of rapidly proliferating tumor cells (32, 121).\n            \nThe TOR-KIs all cause greater cell cycle inhibition and G1 arrest in preclinical studies than rapamycin (91, 112–114, 122). TOR-KIs not only inhibit mTORC1-dependent cyclin D1 translation, but also block AKT-mediated activation of cyclin D1 transcription (112). Furthermore, they more powerfully oppose the action of AKT via inhibition of GSK3-β to stabilize cyclin D1 and cyclin E (33, 35). In addition, mTORC1/2 inhibition would more effectively block AKT- and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of p27, reversing its cytoplasmic mislocalization and leading to more effective cyclin-CDK2 inhibition (123).\n            \nAn additional benefit of mTORC1/2 inhibition may be to impair tumor cell invasion and metastatic potential. The inhibition of AKT/SGK1/RSK1-mediated p27 phosphorylation by TOR-KIs and PI3K/TOR-KIs, in addition to restoring nuclear p27 localization, would also abrogate the pro-oncogenic function acquired when p27pT198 binds RhoA, inhibits actin stability, and activates tumor cell motility and metastasis (63).\n            \nIt is noteworthy that several of the pure TOR-KIs appear to induce apoptosis (112) or autophagy (113, 114), while rapamycin does not. This in part reflects more potent inhibition of AKT, whose antiapoptotic effects are legion (13). In addition to inhibiting protein and lipid biosynthesis, mTORC1/2 inhibitors also have potent antiangiogenic effects. This was shown for Palomid 529 in preclinical in vivo models (124) and may result from more potent inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF1α and HIF2α activation and reduced VEGF production (112). Recent work has shown that HIF2α critically mediates cancer cell–autonomous growth through increased RTK expression (125). More potent inhibition of HIF2α production would oppose RTK accumulation and growth factor independence (125), constituting yet another potential mechanism for the greater efficacy of TOR-KIs over rapalogs.\n            \nDespite promising preclinical and early clinical results with TOR-KIs, resistance to TOR-KIs could still arise via feedback PI3K activation. Despite the loss of mTORC2-mediated S473 phosphorylation of AKT in cells treated with a TOR-KI, mTORC1 inhibition would still promote feedback activation of PI3K- and PDK1-driven phosphorylation of AKT at T308. Constitutively T308-phosphorylated AKT shows modest substrate-dependent action without S473 phosphorylation; this may attenuate the therapeutic efficacy of TOR-KIs (91). Furthermore, the loss of mTORC1-mediated IRS feedback might activate PI3K effectors other than AKT. These molecular insights have stimulated the development of PI3K/TOR-KIs (Table 3). These new PI3K/TOR-KIs have shown powerful effects in xenograft models of breast cancer (126–129), pancreatic cancer (130), melanoma (131), multiple myeloma (132), glioma (129, 133), RCC (134), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (135). Like the TOR-KIs, many dual PI3K/TOR-KIs strongly induce apoptosis (128, 129, 132, 134, 135) and/or autophagy (133). Several also show notable antiangiogenic properties, with significant reduction of xenograft neovascularization (131, 133).\n            \nTogether, these data indicate that relative to rapalogs, TOR-KIs and PI3K/TOR-KIs have the potential to more profoundly inhibit protein and lipid biosynthesis, as well as coordinate arrest of cell growth and cell cycle. In addition, they more effectively oppose angiogenesis, tumor invasion, metastasis, and survival.\nPI3K/TOR-KIs and TOR-KIs in clinical trials.\nSeveral PI3K/TOR-KIs and TOR-KIs have entered clinical trials. The drugs, date of trial initiation, disease sites treated, and planned trial accrual are listed in Tables 2 and 3. This information is largely unpublished and comes from meeting reports of 2009 and 2010 (American Association of Cancer Research [AACR], San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium [SABCS], European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC], and the American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO]) and from postings at ClinicalTrials.gov. Phase I trials of Novartis’s PI3K/TOR-KIs, BEZ235 and BGT226, in advanced solid tumors began in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The BGT226 trial ended in 2009, and this drug will not be developed further, since BEZ235 is both more potent and more bioavailable. No dose-limiting toxicities have been reported for BEZ235, and mild adverse events (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and anorexia) were manageable and reversible upon drug withdrawal. BEZ235 is pharmacodynamically active, exhibiting dose- and schedule-dependent PI3K inhibition (136). A phase I dose escalation study of XL765 (Exelixis) has shown good tolerability, with adverse effects including diarrhea, anorexia, rash, and mild elevations of postprandial insulin levels without effects on glycemia (137). This drug yielded marked disease stabilization in advanced solid tumors. In 2009 and early 2010, additional phase I trials of PI3K/TOR-KIs were initiated with GSK2126458 (GlaxoSmithKline), GDC0980 (Genentech), and PF-04691502 and PF-0521384 (Pfizer).\n            \nTOR-KIs have also entered clinical trials (Table 2), and additional lead compounds are in development. Phase I trials of OSI-027 (OSI Pharmaceuticals) and AZD8055 (AstraZeneca) in solid tumors and lymphoma were initiated in mid-2008, and the latter has moved to phase II trials in endometrial cancer. As a single agent, OSI-027 has shown preliminary evidence of pharmacodynamic activity, as assessed by reduction of phospho-4EBP1; it has also been well tolerated, and dose escalation studies are ongoing (138). OSI-027 is also being tested with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib for non–small cell lung cancers and with temozolamide for gliomas.\n            \nPI3K inhibitors in cancer therapy.\nWhile they are not within the focus of this mTOR review, we would be remiss not to mention the development of a number of pure PI3K inhibitors. These compounds have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (139, 140). As for the TOR-KIs and PI3K/TOR-KIs, early preclinical studies and clinical trials have been promising, showing tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo and favorable tolerability profiles. PI3K inhibitors currently in clinical trials include XL147 (as monotherapy in solid tumors or in combination with erlotinib or carboplatin/paclitaxel), NVP-BKM120, PX-866, GSK1059615 (all as monotherapy in solid tumors), and CAL-101 (as monotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute myelogenous leukemia). Continued development of these compounds, and others that have yet to enter the clinic, will be important as they may complement the action of TOR-KIs and show synergies with other targeted therapies.\n            \nBiomarkers for Rapalog and TOR-KI patient selection.\nIdentification of reliable biomarkers to assist in patient selection and to monitor treatment response is of paramount importance. HER2 amplification in breast cancer; overexpression of other RTKs, PTEN loss, PIK3CA mutations, elevated levels of phosphorylated AKT in many human cancers; cyclin D1 overexpression due to chromosomal translocations in mantle cell lymphoma; and von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) loss in renal cell cancers and Kaposi sarcoma have been identified in preclinical models as putative predictors of rapalog response (141–144). However, the use of PTEN and PIK3CA mutations and AKT phospho-status for predicting rapalog sensitivity has not been fully validated in clinic (145–150). Interestingly, one recent study showed that either PI3K activation or PTEN loss predicted enhanced susceptibility to everolimus in cancer cell lines, but this was abrogated if activating KRAS or BRAF mutations were also present (151). These results were validated in a small cohort of patients with advanced solid tumors: tumors showing PTEN loss and KRAS activation had minimal benefit from everolimus (151).\n            \nTo date, attempts to identify and standardize biomarkers of rapalog response have been largely unsuccessful. The notion that pathway activation or “oncogene addiction” predicates response to pathway inhibition has not always been borne out. This may reflect the complexity of the PI3K/mTOR signaling network and the existence of feedback loops. Predictive factor studies accompanying early trials with rapalogs often had woefully too few tumor numbers to achieve significance (70), and technological challenges limit application of phosphoprotein-based immunohistochemistry (IHC) in human tumor specimens. Moreover, analysis of fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumor specimens may have limited predictive ability for drug responses in metastatic disease due to tumor evolution over time, emphasizing the importance of clinical trial design with real-time tumor analysis. The recently attempted use of genomic methods to identify signaling pathway activation holds promise but requires refinement for clinical application.\n            \nAlthough most predictive biomarker studies have had too few samples for clinical prediction, IHC and genomic analysis of putative drug targets have illuminated drug mechanism. The recent appreciation that rapamycin is a substrate-specific mTORC1 inhibitor, causing transient, if any, 4EBP1 inhibition (90, 91, 112), illuminates why S6K1 and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) phospho-status does not correlate with rapamycin response in preclinical models (149) and is unlikely to predict rapamycin sensitivity in humans. The observed activation of phosphorylated AKT in post–rapalog treatment tumor samples from clinical trials (94) confirmed the importance of feedback mechanisms in resistance and fueled the discovery of new-generation TOR-KIs. In future trials, the phosphorylation status of AKT, 4EBP1, S6K1, and S6 and the presence of PTEN or PIK3CA mutations may prove to be useful response predictors for PI3K/TOR-KIs and TOR-KIs. Moreover, cytoplasmic p27, which is readily detected by IHC, may be a powerful indicator of PI3K/mTOR activation and susceptibility to PI3K/TOR-KIs. Clinical trials with accompanying histopathologic evaluation of pre- and post-treatment effects in skin, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and tumor samples will help define the most biologically relevant targets, ensuring that these agents are delivered to patients most likely to respond.\n\n            \nConcluding remarks and future directions\nThe last decade has witnessed a growing appreciation of the complexity of PI3K/mTOR signaling and of the potential of mTOR-targeted anticancer therapies. Despite the limited efficacy of rapalogs, these drugs have shown clear benefit in mantle cell lymphomas, RCC, and TSC-related tumors, for which few therapeutic options exist. Studies of rapalog action in cell lines and patients have revealed mechanisms underlying their limited clinical impact, including substrate-selective inhibition of mTORC1 and activation of feedback loops. These insights have prompted the development of direct mTOR kinase inhibitors.\nIt remains to be determined whether catalytic inhibition of mTOR and/or PI3K will also give rise to feedback loop activation via novel, as-yet-undiscovered autoregulatory mechanisms. This highlights the need for ongoing design of clinical trials with molecular correlative studies utilizing tumor biopsies. As tolerability profiles for new TOR-KIs and PI3K/TOR-KIs are assessed, correlative analyses are required to identify clinically feasible and reliable biomarkers of response and of the emergence of drug resistance.\nWhile PI3K/TOR-KIs and TOR-KIs may prove more potent as single agents than rapalogs, their greatest efficacy may lie in combinations with other pathway inhibitors. It is increasingly clear that antitumor efficacy and response duration with inhibitors of a single kinase are frequently limited by parallel signaling, bypass pathway activation, or feedback activation of mitogenic pathways. Molecular arguments can be made for testing the new TOR-KIs together with MEK or Src inhibitors, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, EGFR- or HER2-directed therapies, antiangiogenic agents, and, for ER-positive breast cancers, hormonal agents. As signaling complexity in cancers is better understood, therapeutic strategies to inhibit mTOR together with other pivotal biosynthetic, proliferation, and survival pathways hold significant promise.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe apologize to those whose contributions were not quoted due to space limitations and thank Vinnay Jain and Preeti Chaudhary for data on developing drugs.

Patients with advanced EHE diagnosed from 2000 onwards and treated with systemic therapies, were selected. Local pathologic review and molecular confirmation were required. Radiological response was retrospectively assessed by local investigators according to RECIST. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan‐Meier method.\nResults\nOverall, 73 patients were included; 21 had more than one treatment. Thirty‐three patients received anthracyclines regimens, achieving 1 (3%) partial response (PR), 25 (76%) stable disease (SD), 7 (21%) progressive disease (PD). The median (m‐) PFS and m‐OS were 5.5 and 14.3 months respectively. Eleven patients received paclitaxel, achieving 1 (9%) PR, 6 (55%) SD, 4 (36%) PD. The m‐PFS and m‐OS were 2.9 and 18.6 months, respectively. Twelve patients received pazopanib, achieving 3 (25%) SD, 9 (75%) PD. The m‐PFS and m‐OS were.2.9 and 8.5 months, respectively. Fifteen patients received INF‐α 2b, achieving 1 (7%) PR, 11 (73%) SD, 3 (20%) PD. The m‐PFS and m‐OS were 8.9 months and 64.3, respectively. Among 27 patients treated with other regimens, 1 PR (ifosfamide) and 9 SD (5 gemcitabine +docetaxel, 2 oral cyclophosphamide, 2 others) were reported.\nConclusion\nSystemic therapies available for advanced sarcomas have limited activity in EHE. The identification of new active compounds, especially for rapidly progressive cases, is acutely needed.\nKeywords: anthracycline, chemotherapy, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma, interferon, paclitaxel, pazopanib\nAnthracycline‐based regimens, the standard first line treatment in advanced soft tissue sarcomas, paclitaxel and pazopanib have a very limited activity in advanced, progressive epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. In the absence of available, potentially active medical therapies, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma remains today an unmet clinical need.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nCompared to other vascular sarcomas, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE) is marked by peculiar clinical features, defined molecular characteristics and specific treatment challenges.\n1\n\n\nEHE is rarer than angiosarcoma or other vascular sarcomas (incidence rate <1/1,000,000), is more common in females and is often multifocal and/or multicentric at presentation, with lung, liver and bone being the typically involved sites.\n2\n Despite its rarity, it encompasses a wide heterogeneity in clinical behaviour, with cases naturally stable over time as opposed to others which are slowly progressive. A rapidly evolving third variant does exist, which behaves as a high‐grade sarcoma. Similarly, the symptoms burden in this disease can be variable, but overall, a significant impact on quality of life and psychological distress have been recently reported in EHE patients.\n3\n\n\nSerosal effusion and bone metastases have been reported as adverse prognostic factors.\n2\n, \n4\n, \n5\n From the molecular point of view, the WWTR1\n(WW\nDomain\nContaining\nTranscription\nRegulator\n1) ‐ CAMTA1\n(Calmodulin\nBinding\nTranscription\nActivator\n1) and YAP\n(Yes‐associated\nprotein\n1)‐TFE3\n(Transcription\nFactor\nBinding\nTo\nIGHM\nEnhancer\n3) rearrangements are found in approximately 90% and 10% of all cases, respectively.\n6\n, \n7\n Recently, gene fusions involving WWTR1 with a partner different from CAMTA1 have also been reported.\n8\n The detection of these rearrangements is today a hallmark in diagnosis, all the more in those cases marked by aggressive morphological features, where the differential diagnosis with angiosarcoma can be challenging, or atypical presentations. Both WWTR1 and YAP are downstream effectors in the Hippo pathway, which could be therefore involved in the pathogenesis of this rare condition.\n9\n\n\nIn patients with asymptomatic, naturally stable, advanced EHE, watchful waiting is today a reasonable approach, as prolonged stabilities over time or even spontaneous regressions have been reported.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n Conversely, for symptomatic patients or patients with progressive multifocal or multicentric disease, systemic treatments are the standard of care. Liver transplant in patients with multifocal disease confined to the liver has also been investigated, but results are controversial.\n11\n, \n12\n Data currently available on systemic agents are limited to case reports or small single‐institution case series. Anecdotal responses have been reported with pazopanib, which is currently approved in the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas refractory to anthracycline, as well as with other anti‐angiogenic compounds including sorafenib, bevacizumab and apatinib.\n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n mTOR inhibitors (i.e. sirolimus) can control the disease in slowly progressive cases, whereas their activity seems to be limited in more aggressive variants, such as those presenting with serosal effusions.\n5\n, \n19\n, \n20\n In the absence of any alternative potentially active treatment approved other that pazopanib, EHE patients with advanced progressive disease are treated with conventional chemotherapy, which is assumed to have very limited activity.\n13\n, \n21\n\n\nIn this international, observational retrospective effort, we collected all the cases of histologically proven, advanced EHE, diagnosed from 2000 onwards and treated with systemic therapies at the major sarcoma reference centres within the framework of the World\nSarcoma\nNetwork, with the aim of studying their potential. The results are reported herein.\n2. PATIENTS AND METHODS\n2.1. Patient population\nWe considered all patients of any age with advanced EHE, diagnosed from 2000 onwards, and treated with systemic therapies (anthracycline‐based regimens, weekly paclitaxel, pazopanib, INF‐α 2b or other), in front or further line. Patients treated sirolimus were not included in this series, as most of them are the subject of a separate report.\n5\n The positivity of either WWTR1‐CAMTA1 or YAP1‐TFE3 rearrangement, determined by FISH or by positive immunostaining for CAMTA1 or TFE3, was required. Patients were treated at 20 sarcoma reference centres in EU, US, Australia, and Japan, within the World\nSarcoma\nNetwork. Written informed consent to the treatment was obtained as required by local regulation. Approval of this retrospective case series analysis by the Institutional Review Board of each participant institution was required.\n2.2. Study design and data collection\nData were extracted from clinical databases and confirmed through a review of patient files. A questionnaire was circulated among participating institutions, in order to explore the frequency of radiological assessment for patients on treatment, at participating centres. All institutions evaluated disease response radiologically every 2–4 months. All participating sites were asked to provide a retrospective local assessment of treatment response based on RECIST version 1.1.\n22\n Data on radiologic evidence of any disease progression prior to commencing treatment were also collected for all cases with available scans.\nTogether with data collection, a literature search was conducted. We searched for articles written in English, published in PubMed from 1995 until September 2020 with the terms ‘epithelioid haemangioendothelioma’, ‘chemotherapy’, ‘anthracycline’, ‘paclitaxel’, ‘pazopanib’, ‘antiangiogenic’, ‘treatment’. The final reference list was defined on the basis of originality and relevance to the scope of this article.\n2.3. Statistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics and frequency tabulation were used to summarize patient and tumor characteristics. Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on the binomial distribution.\nProgression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method, and survival distributions by group were compared using the log‐rank test. PFS was calculated as the interval from the start of treatment to the date of the first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause or to the date of the last follow‐up. OS was calculated as the interval from the start of treatment to the time of death from any cause or to the date of the last follow‐up. A two‐sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nStatistical analyses were carried out with SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R software (version 3.6.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n3. RESULTS\n3.1. Patient population\nSeventy‐three patients with advanced EHE treated with systemic therapies were identified. The median follow‐up was 35.8 months (interquartile range, IQR, 17.5–93.3) and the median OS was 17.4 months (IQR, 9.3 – not evaluable, NE). Thirty‐three patients received anthracycline‐based regimens, 11 weekly paclitaxel, 12 pazopanib, 15 INF‐α 2b and 27 other agents. Twenty‐one patients received more than one of the selected treatments, and therefore are included in more than one group. The population characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\nPopulation characteristics\n33\n(19.4‐89.5)\nAbbreviation: NA, not applicable.\n73 unique patients.\nIHC o molecular testing.\nReferred to the 1st of the \"other treatments\" of each patient\n3.2. Treatment response and outcome\nThirty‐three patients were included, all evaluable for response. The median follow‐up was 33 months (IQR, 19.4–89.5). In 19 patients (58%) there was evidence of PD prior to commencing treatment, in 14 (42%) there was not. Fifteen patients (45%) received anthracycline as single agent, 9 (27%) in combination with ifosfamide and 9 (27%) in combination with different compounds. Twenty‐nine patients (88%) received anthracycline as a first‐line, 4 (12%) as a second line treatment. At the time of the present analysis, 32 patients completed their treatment. Treatment was discontinued for PD in 15 (47%) cases, for toxicity in 2 (6%), for maximum cumulative anthracycline dose in 14 (44%), and for other reasons in 1 (3%).\nThe best RECIST response with anthracycline‐based regimens was 1 (3%) PR, 25 (76%) SD, and 7 (21%) PD. The ORR was 3% (95%CI: 0%‐16%). The patient who achieved a response was a 30‐year old female, with a CAMTA1 positive EHE involving liver, lung, spleen and lymph nodes, treated with liposomal doxorubicin as a first‐line treatment. Details on the evidence or radiological disease progression prior to commencing treatment are reported in Tables 1 and 2.\nTreatment details and response\nDisease response\n(RECIST 1.1)\nAnthracycline‐based regimens\n(N = 33)\n•0: 29 (88%)\n•1: 4 (12%)\n•≥ 2: 0\nAnthracycline single agent: 15 (45%)\nAnthracycline+ifosfamide: 9 (27%)\nAnthracycline+others: 9 (27%)\nCR: 0\n\nPrior\nPD: 14\n\nNo\nprior\nPD: 11\nPaclitaxel\n(N = 11)\n•0: 8 (73%)\n•1: 3 (27%)\n•≥ 2: 0\nCR: 0\n\nPrior\nPD: 2\n\nNo\nprior\nPD: 4\nPazopanib\n(N = 12)\n•0: 5 (42%)\n•1: 6 (50%)\n•≥ 2: 1 (8%)\nCR: 0\n\nPrior\nPD: 2\n\nNo\nprior\nPD: 1\nINF‐α 2b\n(N = 15)\n•0: 13 (87%)\n•1: 1 (7%)\n•≥ 2: 1 (7%)\nCR: 0\n\nPrior\nPD: 2\n\nNo\nprior\nPD: 1\nAbbreviations: CR, complete response; NA, not applicable; NE, not evaluable; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease.\nThe median PFS (m‐PFS) in this group was 5.5 months (IQR, 3.6 – 89.0, Figure 1A), and the median OS (m‐OS) 14.3 months (IQR, 10.0 ‐ NE, Figure 2A). The 3‐year PFS and OS rates were 25% (95% CI 13%‐48%) and 34% (95% CI 20%‐58%), respectively. No significant differences were noticed between patients with and without evidence of previous progression in terms of m‐PFS (5.4 and 5.5 months, respectively, p = 0.62), or m‐OS (13.7 and 18.4 months, respectively, p = 0.45).\n\nKaplan‐Meier curves for progression‐free survival on anthracycline‐based regimens (A), paclitaxel (B), pazopanib (C) and INF‐α\n2b (D)\n\nKaplan‐Meier curves for overall survival on anthracycline‐based regimens (A), paclitaxel (B), pazopanib (C) and INF‐α\n2b (D)\nEleven patients were included, all evaluable for response. The median follow‐up was 80 months (IQR, 27.2 – 93.3). In 5 patients (45%) there was evidence of PD prior to commencing treatment, in 6 (55%) there was not. Eight patients (73%) received weekly paclitaxel as a first‐line, 3 (27%) as a second‐line treatment. At the time of the present analysis, all patients completed their treatment. Treatment was discontinued for PD in 7 (64%) cases, for toxicity in 1 (9%), for agreement on a treatment holiday in 2 (18%), and for other reasons in 1 (9%).\nThe best RECIST response with weekly paclitaxel was 1 (9%) PR, 6 (55%) SD, and 4 (36%) PD. The ORR was 9% (95%CI: 0%‐41%). The patient who achieved a response was a 38‐year old male, with a YAP1‐TFE3 positive EHE of the lungs with pleural and lymph nodal involvement, treated with weekly paclitaxel as a first‐line treatment. Details on the evidence or radiological disease progression prior to commencing treatment are reported in Tables 1 and 2.\nThe m‐PFS in this group was 2.9 (IQR, 1.5 – 16.4, Figure 1B), and the m‐OS was 18.6 (IQR, 2.8 – NE, Figure 2B). The 3‐year PFS and OS rates were 21% (95% CI: 6%‐71%) and 48% (95% CI: 24%‐95%). In patients with no evidence of previous progression, compared to those who previously progressed, a trend toward a longer m‐PFS (2.0 and 6.9 months, respectively, p = 0.09) and a longer m‐OS (9.2 months vs. NE, p = 0.03) were recorded.\nTwelve patients were included, all evaluable for response. The median follow‐up was 15.4 months (IQR, 11.3 – 17.2). In 10 patients (83%) there was evidence of PD prior to commencing treatment, in 2 (17%) there was not. Five patients (42%) received pazopanib as a first‐line, 6 (50%) as a second‐line treatment and 1 (8%) in further line.

No significant differences were noticed between patients with and without evidence of previous progression in terms of m‐PFS (2.9 months and NE, respectively, p = 0.47) whereas a trend toward a better m‐OS (8.5 months and NE, respectively, p = 0.86) was reported.\nFifteen patients were included, all evaluable for response. The median follow‐up was 35.8 months (IQR, 17.5 – 98.4). In 12 patients (80%) there was evidence of PD prior to commencing treatment, in 3 (20%) there was not. Thirteen patients (87%) received INF‐α 2b as a first‐line, 1 (7%) as a second line treatment and 1 (7%) in further line. At the time of the present analysis, all patients completed their treatment. Treatment was discontinued for PD in 11 (73%) cases, for clinical choice after prolonged stability in 2 (13%) and for drug unavailability in 2 (13%).\nThe best RECIST response with INF‐α 2b was 1 (7%) PR, 11 (73%) SD, and 3 (20%) PD. The ORR was 7% (95%CI: 0%‐32%). The patient who achieved a PR was a 48‐year old male, with a WWTR1‐CAMTA positive EHE involving liver and lungs treated with INF‐α 2b as a first‐line treatment. Details on the evidence or radiological disease progression prior to commencing treatment are reported in Tables 1 and 2.\nThe median m‐PFS in this group was 8.9 months (IQR, 4.0 – 33.3, Figure 1D), and the m‐OS was 64.3 (IQR, 15.2 – NE, Figure 2D). The 3‐year OS and PFS rates were 17% (95% CI: 5–56%) and 54% (95% CI: 3–90%), respectively. In patients with no evidence of previous progression, compared to those who previously progressed, a trend toward a longer m‐PFS (32.6 vs. 8.8 months, respectively, p = 0.36) and a trend toward a longer m‐OS (NE vs. 64.3 months, p = 0.91) were noticed.\nAmong 27 patients treated with other regimens, 1 PR (prior PD, high‐dose ifosfamide) and 9 SD (all with prior PD, 5 gemcitabine plus docetaxel, 2 oral cyclophosphamide, 2 others) were reported.\nKaplan‐Meier curves for PFS and OS on anthracycline‐based regimes, paclitaxel, pazopanib and interferon are reported in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Results on treatment and outcome for each regimen, and association with prior evidence of PD, are summarized in Table 2.\n4. DISCUSSION\nThis academic, multi‐institutional, international, retrospective study collected the largest series ever of patients affected by advanced EHE treated with systemic therapies. Seventy‐three patients (33 treated with anthracycline‐based regimens, 11 with weekly paclitaxel, 12 with pazopanib, 15 with INF‐α 2b and 27 with other agents were included. Anthracycline‐based regimens, the standard first‐line therapy in advanced soft tissue sarcomas, showed a minor activity in advanced EHE (ORR of 3%, m‐PFS of 5.5 months). Similarly, a limited activity was seen with weekly‐paclitaxel (ORR of 9%, m‐PFS of 2.9 months) and pazopanib (no responses, m‐PFS of 2.9 months), while INF‐α 2b, which is currently not approved in the disease, resulted in an ORR of 7% and a m‐PFS of 8.9 months.\nOur study is limited by its retrospective nature, both in the collection of clinical data and assessment of tumor response. The retrospective design limited a robust assessment of disease progression prior to commencing treatment, which would have been extremely valuable given the unpredictable natural history of EHE, and did not allow a reliable collection of data on the impact of systemic therapies in symptoms control and quality of life. Also, the number of patients included in each treatment group is limited. Despite these limitations, this is the largest series of EHE published so far and it was collected through a worldwide effort, with the contribution of 20 sarcoma reference centres. Because all of the contributing institutions are part of a network dedicated to the research and care of sarcomas, a reasonable level of consistency in terms of procedures can be assumed (including the frequency of radiological assessments during treatment). The confirmation of diagnosis by an expert sarcoma pathologist, together with the determination of CAMTA‐1 / TFE‐3 status is a major strength of this study.\nUnfortunately, we could not observe any relevant anti‐tumor activity from any of the agents used. Notably, the m‐PFS for most systemic therapies in this series was lower than 6 months. This points to a patient population selected for an aggressive behaviour at the time of commencing systemic therapy. This is in line with the tendency of all expert centres to delay any treatment until the development of clear‐cut symptomatic or radiological progression. Indeed, in the absence of any approved treatment option, patients with advanced, progressive EHE are currently managed predominantly with conventional chemotherapy and pazopanib, similar to most advanced STS subtypes. The results of previous studies on systemic treatments in advanced EHE are summarized in Table 3.\nTABLE 3.\nSummary of previous studies on systemic treatments in advanced epithelioid haemangioendothelioma\nMascarenhas RC et al.\nOncology. 2004\nThalidomide\n1\nNo\nOral cyclophosphamide +prednisolone\nNo\nCR\nNA\n1\nTaxol +Bevacizumab\nBevacizumab\nMetronomic cycplophosphamide\nMetronomic cycplophosphamide\nIFN, weekly paclitaxel,\n5‐FU, caelyx, celecoxib, celecoxib +lenalidomide, doxorubicin, imatinib, carboplatin and paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide and vinblastine, axitinib, cyclophosphamide and etoposide, ifosfamide and doxorubicin,\nthalidomide, axitinib, pazopanib, semaxinib, sunitinib.\n1\nNo\nDoxorubicin\nSirolimus (plasma level of 15–20 ng/dL)\n12 (median PFS)\n26 (median PFS)\nZheng Z\net al.

To the best of our knowledge, only 2 responses have been reported with doxorubicin in 1997 and 2010, in two metastatic EHE patients, however, the diagnosis was not confirmed by either molecular testing or IHC.\n26\n, \n27\n Cioffi A. et al. did not record any radiological responses in 16 advanced EHE patients treated with anthracyclines, with a m‐PFS of 4.8 months.\n19\n Similarly, no PR were reported by Yousaf N. et al and in most case reports available.\n13\n Consistent with these findings and on a larger scale, our series confirmed the very limited activity of anthracycline in advanced EHE, with only 1 PR observed (ORR: 3%) and a m‐PFS of 5.5 months. Four patients were treated with liposomal doxorubicin, all with prior evidence of PD, and a PR and 2 SD were observed. In the literature, 3 case reports highlighting a PR and a prolonged disease control in advanced, rapidly progressive EHE treated with liposomal doxorubicin, are available. All this would suggest a possible role for this agent in the management of progressive EHE.\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n\n\nPaclitaxel has a recognized activity in vascular sarcomas, especially in angiosarcoma, in which an ORR in the range of 20–50% across different series has been reported.\n31\n, \n32\n In advanced EHE, no responses to paclitaxel have been described in the few case‐reports available, nor in the retrospective series by Yousaf N. et al, where 6 patients received paclitaxel across different lines with a median treatment duration of 3 months.\n13\n Consistently, only 1 PR was observed (ORR=9%) over 11 patients treated with weekly paclitaxel in this series, predominantly (73%) as a front‐line, with a m‐PFS of 2.9 months.\nResponses to pazopanib in EHE have been described in 4 different clinical reports on previously progressive patients, among which a retrospective study from EORTC exploring the activity of pazopanib in a series of vascular sarcomas.\n14\n, \n15\n, \n33\n, \n34\n In this last study, 1 CR and 1 PR were observed over 10 advanced EHE treated.\n15\n Conversely, no response was seen in the single case described by Yousaf N et al.\n13\n Similarly, no responses were seen in our study of 12 EHE patients who received pazopanib, mostly in first and second line, with a short m‐PFS (2.9 months). Notably, in these previously published studies molecular confirmation of diagnosis is lacking.\nThe activity of INF‐α in advanced EHE has already been reported, being used both in the paediatric and adult population.\n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n The agent was used assuming an anti‐angiogenic effect. Though in our series only 1 PR was observed in 15 patients, m‐PFS was longer than any other agent, e.g. 8.9 months. Taken together, available results seem to confirm the potential role of interferon in the management of this rare sarcoma subtype, though the drug is not approved for this indication.\nSimilarly, sirolimus is also potentially active in the treatment of advanced EHE, with a reported ORR of 10% and a m‐PFS of 13 months in previously progressive patients.\n5\n There are some patients with an aggressive behavior, often marked by a serosal effusion, who respond less to therapy.\n5\n In this series, we did not to include patients treated with sirolimus, as they are the subject of a separate paper.\nIn brief, it is clear from this series, and the literature, that we lack any standard medical therapy in EHE. In particular, active drugs in STS are essentially inactive in EHE. An old agent such as IFN has some activity but is not approved for this disease. The same is true of other agents such as mTOR inhibitors, for which retrospective and anecdotal evidence points to slightly less than one half of previously progressing patients free of progression at two years.\n5\n, \n20\n Undoubtedly, the natural history and uncertain prognosis of these patients make clinical studies very difficult, while a proportion of them does not require any treatment. Indeed, controlled studies are virtually impossible due to the rarity of disease, but a distinct number of patients present with an aggressive clinical behavior and are in need for front‐line active treatments.\n5\n\n\nClearly, any prospective study on any new therapy would need a clear background landscape in terms of definition of the disease and its natural history. To this aim, a global consensus development process is in place. At least, it may clarify which subgroups of patients are more in need for any medical therapy and which is their expected prognosis. Indeed, the biomolecular profile of the disease is now better understood and at least is able to single out true EHE from other vascular sarcomas, primarily angiosarcoma. Failing to do so in the past was a major obstacle even to developing new therapies. Further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis might obviously help find new therapeutic targets. The Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC) have conducted a phase 2 trial of trametinib in unresectable/ metastatic EHE. Other global efforts are ongoing, and it is worth highlighting that they involve patient groups.\n5.

The tumors often present as multiple nodules involving various tissue planes, including superficial and deep soft tissues as well as bone. Recurrent SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusions have been reported as the hallmark genetic abnormality in PHE, however, in our experience, a number of cases with typical histology lack this genetic abnormality. In this study, we identify a novel ACTB-FOSB gene fusion, which is as prevalent as the initial translocation reported. We selected 15 consecutive cases of PHE with typical morphologic features which had material for molecular testing. The cohort included 10 males and 5 females, ranging in age from 17 to 58 years (median age – 33 years; mean age – 35.3 years). Eight (53%) cases were located in the lower extremities (foot, calf, tibia, thigh), 5 (33%) were located in the trunk, abdomen or pelvis (abdominal wall – 2, shoulder, back, ischium) and 2 (13%) were located in the upper extremity (humerus and hand). Ten (67%) cases had multifocal presentation and 5 (33%) presented as solitary lesions. Three (20%) cases were located only in the superficial dermis and subcutaneous tissues, 4 (27%) involved the superficial and deep soft tissue and 8 (53%) cases involved only the deep soft tissue and bone. Using FISH and ARCHER fusionplex analysis we identified a novel ACTB-FOSB gene fusion in 7 cases, while the remaining 8 had the previously described SERPINE1-FOSB fusion. The clinicopathologic features and behavior of PHE associated with the ACTB-FOSB gene fusion were similar to those harboring the SERPINE1-FOSB; except that tumors with the ACTB variant were more often associated with solitary presentation. In conclusion, our results expand the spectrum of genetic alterations in PHE with a novel gene fusion identified in half of the cases. We speculate that some of the novel targeted therapies that have shown promise in SERPINE1-FOSB-positive PHE might also be beneficial in this molecular subset.\nKeywords: ACTB, SERPINE1, FOSB, Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma\nINTRODUCTION\nPseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a rare vascular neoplasm, with only about hundred cases reported to date. [1–13] The tumors are often multicentric, involving multiple tissue planes and occur with predilection in young adults. In the latest WHO classification, PHE is categorized in the intermediate group, as a rarely metastasizing endothelial neoplasm.[14] The varying terminologies used reflect the diverse morphologic spectrum. In 2003, Billings et al.[15] were the first to describe this vascular neoplasm, using the term ‘epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma’, emphasizing its close resemblance to epithelioid sarcoma. Subsequently, Hornick and Fletcher [3] reported a large series of 50 cases expanding the histologic spectrum, to include cases with predominant spindle cell cytomorphology, reminiscent of myoid differentiation, and proposed the term ‘pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma’, currently the preferred designation used in the WHO.\nThe first reported genetic abnormality in PHE was a balanced t(7;19)(q22;q13) translocation in an index case of a 14 year old girl with multiple subcutaneous nodules in the chest wall.[16] Subsequently, Walther et al., using a combined molecular approach of chromosome banding analysis,fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and mRNA sequencing, cloned the gene partners revealing a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion. [17]\nTriggered by a group of PHE cases with classic histologic features lacking SERPINE1 gene rearrangement, we set out to perform a molecular evaluation using FISH and ARCHER assays to further unravel alternative novel gene abnormalities in this tumor.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatient Selection and Histologic Diagnosis\nArchival and personal consultation material (CRA) from adult and pediatric patients with diagnosis of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma or epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma were retrieved from the pathology files at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in which additional material was available for ancillary testing. Fourteen cases were identified in which the diagnosis of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma was confirmed by re-review of the histologic slides. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue was available on all the cases selected for the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at MSKCC.\nFISH\nFISH on interphase nuclei from paraffin-embedded 4-micron sections was performed applying custom probes using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC), covering and flanking genes FOSB, SERPINE1, ACTB, ZFP36, and WWTR1. BAC clones were chosen according to UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu), see Supplementary Table 1 and as previously described.[18] The BAC clones were obtained from BACPAC sources of Children’s Hospital of Oakland Research Institute (CHORI) (Oakland, CA) (http://bacpac.chori.org). DNA from individual BACs was isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions, labeled with different fluorochromes in a nick translation reaction, denatured, and hybridized to pretreated slides. Slides were then incubated, washed, and mounted with DAPI in an antifade solution. The genomic location of each BAC set was verified by hybridizing them to normal metaphase chromosomes. Two hundred successive nuclei were examined using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan, Oberkochen, Germany), controlled by Isis 5 software (Metasystems, Newton, MA). A positive score was interpreted when at least 20% of the nuclei showed a break-apart signal. Nuclei with incomplete set of signals were omitted from the score.\nARCHER Assay\nArcher FusionPlex™-targeted RNA sequencing analysis was performed in one case (case 2). The solid fusion assay is a targeted RNA-based panel that utilizes the Archer Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP™) technology and next generation sequencing to detect gene fusions in solid tumor and sarcoma samples. The Archer™ custom solid panel targets 62 genes known to be recurrently involved in rearrangements associated with these tumors. RNA is extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor material followed by cDNA synthesis. cDNA undergoes end repair, dA tailing, and ligation with Illumina molecular barcode adapters. SPRI-cleaned ligated fragments are subject to two rounds of PCR amplifications using two sets of gene specific primers (GSP1 used in PCR1 and a nested GSP2 pool used in PCR2) and a primer complementary to the Illumina adapter. At the end of two PCR steps, the final targeted amplicons are fully functional and ready for sequencing on an Illumina Miseq instrument (2×150bp). The Archer™ analysis software V5.0 used for data analysis to identify the fusion.\nMSK-IMPACT Assay\nDetails of the MSK-IMPACT assay have been previously published. [20] Briefly, MSK-IMPACT is a comprehensive molecular profiling assay that involves hybridization capture and deep sequencing of all exons and selected introns of up to 468 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, allowing the detection of point mutations, small and large insertions or deletions, and rearrangements.\nRESULTS\nClinicopathologic Features\nThe clinicopathologic features of the 15 cases are summarized in Table 1. The tumors occurred in 10 males and 5 females and the patients ranged in age from 17 to 58 years (median age – 33 years; mean age – 35.3 years). Most (8, 53%) cases were located in the lower extremities (foot, calf, tibia, thigh), followed by the trunk, abdomen and pelvis (abdominal wall – 2, shoulder, back, ischium) in 5 (33%) cases and the upper extremity (humerus and hand) in 2 (13%). Two-thirds (10, 67%) of the cases had a multifocal presentation, while the remaining third (5, 33%) were solitary lesions. In 5 of the 10 (50%) cases with multifocal presentation, the lesions were located in different tissue planes including subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle and bone. The remaining 5 cases (50%) with multifocal presentation showed multiple lesions in the same tissue plane. Twelve (80%) cases involved the deep structures, of which 8 cases exclusively involved the deep tissues and the remaining 4 showed involvement of both superficial and deep tissues. All of the cases that involved deep structures, except one, involved the bone. Three cases (20%) were located exclusively in the superficial dermis and subcutaneous tissues.\nClinicopathologic features of PHE\nanalyzed by ARCHER fusionplex\nanalyzed by MSK-IMPACT\nM-male, F-female; SUP-Superficial; ST – soft tissue; SQ-subcutaneous; NED, no evidence of disease; AWD, alive with disease; FU, follow up; na, not available.\nThe tumors showed a wide morphologic spectrum. (Figures 1 and 2) Most tumors showed a multinodular and infiltrative growth within the subcutaneous fat or skeletal muscle. They typically lacked a lobular growth pattern or encapsulation. The lesions were composed of a mixture of spindle and epithelioid cells in variable proportions. A subset of cases had mostly spindle cell morphology, arranged in short fascicles or patternless growth within a fibrotic stroma. These plump spindle cells had abundant dense eosinophilic cytoplasm and ovoid nuclei with open chromatin and mildly prominent nucleoli. In other cases, the epithelioid component predominated, being composed of relatively monomorphic epithelioid to rhabdoid cells with abundant densely eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei with smooth contours and fine chromatin. Due to the eosinophilic quality and accentuated cell membranes, the tumors closely resembled the appearance of a smooth muscle neoplasm. Most tumors had a low level of cytologic atypia, except for Case 1, showing a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism in the primary lesion, which became severe in subsequent lesions after chemoradiation. This patient, a 45 year-old female presenting with a ischium bone lesion, was initially misdiagnosed as a sarcomatoid carcinoma of undetermined origin due to its strong cytokeratin positivity. (Figure 1) All except one case showed a low mitotic activity, of <5 MF/10 high power fields (HPFs). Case 1 described above had 25 MF/10 HPFs in the primary and subsequently developed lesions. No necrosis was identified in any of the tumors. A consistent finding seen in most of the tumors was the associated fibrotic stromal component. None of the cases showed a hemorrhagic background or any evidence of vascular lumen formation. Furthermore, blister cells, cells with intracytoplasmic vacuoles, were not present. In addition, there was a variable inflammatory infiltrate within some of the tumors, composed of either neutrophils or lymphocytes, but typically not eosinophils.\n\n(A, B) Case 4 (25/M, foot) showing bone involvement by a cellular neoplasm (A), showing a mixture of epithelioid and spindle cells (B); (C) Case 2 (54/F, shoulder) showing involvement of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue with spindle cell neoplasm in a fascicular pattern; (D) Case 5 (19/M, calf) showing infiltration of the skeletal muscle by tumor cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. (E-I) Case 1 (45/F, ischium) showing cellular spindle cell areas with increased mitoses (E) and other areas showing pleomorphic epithelioid cells (F); immunohistochemical stains positive for CD31 (G), ERG (H) and Cytokeratin (I).\n\n(A) Case 14 (25/M, calf) showing cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrotic stroma. (B, C) Case 12 (48/M, back) and Case 13 (58/M, abdominal wall) showing epithelioid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm with accentuated membranes compactly arranged, suggestive of an epithelioid smooth muscle tumor. (D) Case 9 (33/M, tibia) showing spindle to epithelioid cells in a hyalinized stroma with prominent normal vasculature in the background.\nImmunohistochemical staining results were available in all except one case. CD31 was positive in all 14 cases tested, however, in 5 cases showing only focal or patchy staining. In contrast, ERG, tested in 10 cases, was diffusely positive in all. (Figure 1) Cytokeratin, tested in 11 cases, was expressed in all, with half of the cases showing patchy positivity. Desmin and / or SMA stains were performed on 10 cases and were negative.\nA novel recurrent ACTB-FOSB fusion was identified in half of the cases\nFISH studies showed rearrangements of FOSB gene in all of the 15 cases, however, 7 cases (47%) lacked SERPINE1 gene abnormalities. These cases were further analyzed for other known gene partners of FOSB and FOS fusions described in various vascular neoplasms, including ZFP36, WWTR1 and ACTB. Interestingly, all of the 7 cases showed a rearrangement in the ACTB gene (Figure 3), in keeping with an ACTB-FOSB gene fusion. Furthermore, ARCHER FusionPlex RNA assay, performed in Case 2, showed a fusion transcript between exon 3 of ACTB gene and exon 2 of FOSB, thereby confirming the ACTB-FOSB gene fusion.

(B-C) FISH analysis shows break-apart signals consistent with rearrangements of FOSB (B) and ACTB (C) genes (red, centromeric; green, telomeric; case 3).\nThe 7 tumors occurred in 5 males and 2 females, with ages ranging from 19 to 54 years (median – 38 years). More than half (4, 57%) of the tumors presented as solitary lesions and 3 (43%) showed multifocal presentation. The anatomic sites included lower extremity (4 cases), shoulder, humerus and anterior abdominal wall. Five (71%) tumors had a deep location with one involving the deep soft tissue and 4 cases involving the bone. Two (29%) cases were located in the superficial dermis and subcutaneous tissue.\nThe cohort of PHE with SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusions show similar clinicopathologic features\nEight (53%) cases showed SERPINE1 gene rearrangement, in keeping with a SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusion. The tumors occurred in 6 males and 2 females with ages ranging from 17 to 58 years (median age – 31.5 years). All except one showed multifocal presentation. The tumor sites included lower extremity in 5 cases, and one each involved the abdominal wall, back and hands. Three cases involved only the deep structures, 4 involved the deep and superficial tissues and 1 case involved only the superficial dermis and subcutaneous tissue.\nTargeted Exome Sequencing showed no additional genetic alterations\nMSK-IMPACT assay, a targeted exome sequencing next-generation assay of 468 genes, was performed in 4 cases (cases 1, 8, 10 and 15), one of which (case 1) had an ACTB-FOSB gene fusion and was associated with atypical histologic features and markedly increased mitotic activity. The other two (cases 8 and 10) had a SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusion. No additional genetic alterations (mutations and copy number alterations) were identified in any of the four cases.\nFollow-up and management\nSurgery was the main therapy applied, with 10 of the 11 cases, in which data was available, having undergone surgical excision. In case 1, in addition to surgery, the patient received chemotherapy and radiation. In one patient (case 9), a 33 year-old man with multiple bone lesions, radiofrequency ablation was performed instead. The treatment information was unavailable in the remaining 3 cases.\nFollow-up data was available in 9 cases with duration ranging from 3 to 66 months. Seven (78%) patients had no evidence of disease (NED) and 2 (22%) were alive with disease (AWD).\nDISCUSSION\nGene fusions involving FOS and FOSB have been identified recently in both benign and intermediate epithelioid vascular neoplasms, including epithelioid hemangioma and PHE. [17, 18, 20]. In epithelioid hemangioma, FOSB is commonly fused to ZFP36, with rare examples having WWTR1 and ACTB as the gene partners ([20] and CRA personal communications). This molecular subset of epithelioid hemangiomas with FOSB-gene rearrangements is often associated with worrisome histologic features, including increased cellularity, nuclear pleomorphism and focal necrosis [20]. An additional genetic group of epithelioid hemangiomas, preferentially occurring in skeletal anatomic sites, is characterized by recurrent gene fusions involving the FOS gene with a variety of gene partners, including LMNA and VIM [18, 21]. FOS and FOSB genes, mapping to chromosome 14q24.3 and 19q13, respectively, belong to the Fos gene family which also includes FOSL1 and FOSL2 genes. [22] The FOS and FOSB genes encode a transcription factor that dimerizes with members of the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), constituting the major components of the activating protein-1 (AP-1) complex. [23] The AP-1 transcription factor binds to TPA-responsive elements of the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes, thereby regulating a wide variety of physiological and tumorigenic processes including angiogenesis. [24–26] The mechanism through which an identical ACTB-FOSB fusion triggers the pathogenesis of two distinct vascular neoplasms, characterized by either benign or intermediate grande of malignancy, with or without vasoformative properties, remains to be determined.\nThe genetic alterations of PHE have only recently been identified. Trombetta et al., in 2011, identified a t(7;19)(q22;q13) translocation by conventional karyotyping.[16] Although FISH studies identified the breakpoint regions, RT-PCR studies failed to demonstrate the genes involved in the fusion. In a subsequent study, Walther et al.[17] identified a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion in two cases by using RNA-seq methodology. Further screening of 8 additional PHE cases by FISH showed evidence of the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion, in keeping with a highly recurrent genetic abnormality. However, in a recent study by Pradhan et al. only 3 of the 6 cases analyzed by FISH showed evidence of the SEPINE1-FOSB gene fusion. [7] Moreover, only 53% of the cases in our current study showed evidence of a SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusion. In the remaining 7 cases, SERPINE1 rearrangement was not present, prompting us to further investigate alternative gene partners, including those previously identified in epithelioid hemangioma, such as WWTR1 and ZFP36 [20] and ACTB (CRA personal communications). Interestingly, all 7 cases showed an ACTB gene rearrangement in keeping with an ACTB-FOSB fusion. ARCHER fusionplex assay performed in one of the cases confirmed an in-frame ACTB-FOSB fusion involving exon 3 of ACTB and exon 2 of FOSB gene. The breakpoints of FOSB gene seen in the ACTB-FOSB variant were similar to those previously reported in SERPINE1-FOSB and ZFP36-FOSB gene fusions, involving exon 2 of FOSB gene.[17, 20]\nThe FOSB transcription factor consists of an N-terminal FOS homology domain, a DNA binding bZIP (basic leucine zipper) domain and a C-terminal proline-rich transactivation domain. [26] The bZIP domain and the C-terminal transactivation domain are typically conserved in the FOSB fusion oncoprotein. [20] FOSB expression has been shown to be significantly increased in cases of epithelioid hemangioma and PHE with FOSB-associated gene fusions, compared to other tumors, which can be detected immunohistochemically. [17, 20]\nBeta-actin (ACTB) is an ubiquitously expressed gene, which has been previously involved in other recurrent gene fusions in soft tissue neoplasms. It was initially reported to partner with the GLI1 gene in a distinctive lesion known as ‘pericytoma with t(7;12) translocation’.[28, 29] More recently, this peculiar group of tumors has been expanded to include a cohort of malignant epithelioid neoplasms defined by GLI1–associated fusions with various partners including ACTB, MALAT1 and PTCH1 genes.[30] The mechanism of GLI1 oncogenic activation in the ACTB-GLI1 fusion occurs by promoter swapping with the ubiquitously expressed ACTB, leading to the deregulation of GLI1 expression and its downstream targets. [30] We speculate that a similar mechanism of promoter swapping might be implicated in vascular tumors with ACTB-FOSB gene fusion, resulting in the overexpression and oncogenic activation of FOSB.\nThe evolving nomenclature of PHE reflects the morphologic overlap with other pathologic entities. The designation of ‘epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma’ was proposed by Billings et al. [15] Their study included 7 such cases, initially diagnosed as epithelioid sarcomas, which were composed of sheets, ill-defined nodules or fascicles of epithelioid cells in a desmoplastic stroma. They noted the distinct lack of vasoformation and hemorrhage in these tumors, despite being a vascular neoplasm. In keeping with these observations, none of the cases in our study, including the ACTB-FOSB fusion positive tumors, showed any vasoformation, putative primitive vascular features such as intracytoplasmic vacuoles, blister cells or presence of extravasated hemorrhage. Immunohistochemically, apart from cytokeratin positivity, all tumors showed positivity for vascular markers CD31 and FLI1 confirming the vascular origin. Based on their indolent clinical course, the tumors were regarded as tumors of intermediate malignancy (hemangioendothelioma category). The term ‘pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma’ was subsequently proposed by Hornick et al. [3] in a large study of 50 cases, due to their distinctive cytologic features with abundant brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and rhabdomyoblast-like appearance. An associated stromal neutrophilic infiltrate was noted in one-third of the cases. Moreover, the authors highlighted the multifocal presentation in different tissue planes, the risk for locoregional recurrences and an overall indolent behavior with low risk of metastasis.\nIn addition to the lack of overt vasoformative properties, the PHE immunohistochemistry further adds to the morphologic non-conformity as a vascular neoplasm. In the study by Hornick et al., half of the cases were negative for CD31, while none were positive for CD34. FLI-1 was the only vascular marker consistently positive in all of the cases.[3] Our study confirmed these findings, CD31 showing only focal and patchy staining in most cases. However, ERG was diffusely and strongly positive in all of the cases, suggesting that ERG and/or FLI1 are better substitute vascular markers which can be used in the diagnosis of PHE. Interestingly, CD34 has been reported to be negative in all of the cases analyzed in different studies [3, 7, 15] and should not be used as a vascular marker in this setting. As previously reported myogenic markers, such as SMA and Desmin, were negative in all of the cases.\nThe consistent positivity for cytokeratin, typically with a strong and diffuse staining pattern, represents a significant pitfall in the diagnosis of PHE, especially in the context of a tumor lacking vascular channel formation and hemorrhagic stroma. [3, 15] The differential diagnoses vary depending on the anatomic location, with acral/superficial tumors raising the possibility of an epithelioid sarcoma. However, most, if not all, epithelioid sarcomas show loss of INI1 (SMARCB1) expression, [31] which is typically retained in PHE. In deep seated locations, including skeletal muscle or bone, especially in the context of multifocal presentation, the cytokeratin positivity raises the consideration of a metastatic/ sarcomatoid carcinoma. Two of the cases in this study were initially considered to be metastatic carcinoma displaying a prominent desmoplastic stroma. An extended panel of immunohistochemical stains, including vascular markers such as CD31, ERG and FLI1, should be performed in the setting of a sarcomatoid tumor in the absence of a clinically detectable primary site, to exclude the diagnosis of PHE. Furthermore, immunohistochemical stain for FOSB has recently been shown to be a sensitive immunohistochemical marker in the evaluation of PHE. [32, 33]\nAdditional considerations in the differential diagnosis of PHE are other vascular neoplasms, particularly epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, a low grade malignant neoplasm which also lacks mature vascular channel formation and stromal hemorrhage.[34] However, epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas show a variable number of blister cells with intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles and a distinct chondromyxoid stroma, which are not seen in PHE. Genetically, these tumors are characterized by a different chromosomal translocation, resulting in a WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion in >95% of the cases.[35] In contrast, most epithelioid hemangiomas have a distinct morphologic appearance, with a lobular architecture of well-formed blood vessels lined by hobnailed endothelial cells, abundant hemorrhagic stroma and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate.[18, 20, 36] However, the presence of similar FOSB gene rearrangements, including 2 epithelioid hemangiomas with an identical ACTB-FOSB gene fusion (CRA unpublished observations), raise the possibility of a morphologic spectrum between epithelioid hemangioma and PHE. Certainly from a clinical standpoint, both pathologic entities have similar clinical presentations, with often multiple lesions involving various tissue planes. However, morphologically, as described above, the tumors show distinct microscopic features, with no significant overlap. (Figures 1 and 3)\nThe multifocal presentation of PHE in different tissue planes is rather intriguing, and similar to that seen in other benign and low grade vascular neoplasms such as epithelioid hemangiomas and epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas. One consideration is the so-called ‘field effect’, with multiple synchronous or metachronous tumors occurring in the same anatomic region, in keeping with a multiclonal process. Another possibility is locoregional metastasis from a single clone of disease within one area of the body, which might include various tissue planes, typically in the extremity. In the setting of multifocal epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, Errani et al [37] confirmed the monoclonality process by screening the fusion DNA breakpoints of separate nodules, which showed an identical WWTR1-CAMTA1 gene fusion break. These results support the loco-regional metastasis phenomenon, and suggest that multifocal PHE might evolve in a similar pattern.\nPHE tend to behave in an indolent manner, with often local recurrences but rare distant metastases. In the report by Billings et al. [15], 2 of the 7 (29%) patients developed local recurrence, but none distant spread. In the study by Hornick et al. [3], 18 of the 31 (58%) patients with follow-up developed local recurrence, with 5 of them having multiple recurrences. One patient had a solitary regional lymph node metastasis and another patient developed distant metastasis 16 years after the primary lesion excision. Only one of the 31 patients in their series succumbed of disease. Rare cases with a more aggressive clinical course, including early multiple pulmonary metastases, have been reported.[38] None of the cases in our series showed distant spread, i.e. lymph node or lung metastatic implants, and all patients with available follow-up are still alive. The main therapy for PHEs has been surgical removal of solitary or pauci-multifocal lesions, with either en bloc or marginal excisions of tissue planes involved. Cytotoxic therapy has been attempted with little benefit.[6] Targeted therapy with inhibitors of mTOR like Sirolimus and Everolimus have shown benefit in some of the cases.[2, 6, 39] Recently, targeted therapy with Telatinib, a FLT1, FLT4 and PDGFRA receptor inhibitor, has been shown to be an effective therapy in PHE with a single case of a 17 year old male with multiple skin lesions in the head and neck showing complete remission after 4 years on the drug.[13] The study also showed that, in vitro, telatinib indirectly affects the expression of SERPINE1-FOSB, the driver genetic alteration in PHE, and thus could potentially be a highly specific therapy option in patients with multifocal/inoperable PHE. We speculate that this could be effective in the ACTB-FOSB fusion associated PHE.\nIn conclusion, our study expands the spectrum of genetic alterations in PHE, showing recurrent ACTB-FOSB fusions in half of the cases tested. The ACTB-FOSB molecular subset appears to have similar pathologic features and clinical outcome compared to the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion associated PHEs. It remains to be determined if the newer targeted therapies shown to have promising clinical benefit in the PHE with SERPINE1-FOSB fusion, will also be effective in this alternative ACTB-FOSB variant.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Figure 1: (A) MRI image of a solitary PHE with an ACTB - FOSB fusion involving the calf muscle (case 6, 24/M).

The treatments of breast cancer require the cooperation of a multidisciplinary setting and taking tumor load and molecular makers into account. For early breast cancer, breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy or mastectomy alone remains the standard management, and the administration of adjuvant systemic therapy is decided by the status of lymph nodes, hormone receptors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2. For metastatic breast cancer, the goal of treatments is to prolong survival and maintain quality of life. This review will present the current advances and controversies of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, and other innovative treatment strategies in early-stage and metastatic breast cancer.\nKeywords: breast cancer, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among female patients and is the leading cause of cancer-related death.1 There were 300,590 new cases and 43,700 deaths of invasive breast cancer in the United States based on the 2023 prediction, accounting for approximately 30% of female cancers.1 The treatments of breast cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy (RT), endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, and the therapeutic schedules require the cooperation of multiple subspecialties. For non-metastatic breast cancer, surgery-based treatment is the standard management, and chemotherapy-based preoperative systemic therapy can reduce tumor volume of the breast, making breast conservation possible, and decreasing the need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).2 Systemic treatment remains the preferred option for metastatic breast cancer, and surgery is only used for palliative therapy in selected metastatic patients.3 The advances in endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy provide additional treatments for patients with metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer. Some innovative therapies are also being investigated, such as gene therapy, vaccines, adoptive cell therapies, including T cell receptor therapy and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy, and achieved promising results. This review aims to summarize the current status and controversies of surgery, chemotherapy, RT, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, and other innovative therapies in breast cancer, and provides better management for oncologists.\nSurgery\nBreast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy with or without immediate reconstruction are both well-established local managements for early invasive breast cancer. The widespread use of systematic treatments in past decades led to the reduction of locoregional recurrence rates (LRR) and distant metastasis rates, and the 10-year LRR of BCS followed by RT was 2–3% for estrogen receptor (ER) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer and 5% for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which was similar to that after mastectomy in early breast cancer.4,5 In addition, patients with BCS+RT had better cosmetic effects and life satisfaction compared with mastectomy.6 Therefore, BCS following RT is the intended surgical standard of care for most breast cancers. However, the selection of BCS should still be cautious for patients with diffuse suspicious micro-calcifications, multicentric cancer, unable to obtain negative margins, and having contraindications to RT.7 Younger age, lobular carcinoma, and aggressive subtypes, such as triple-negative and HER2 positive diseases are not contraindications for BCS. For patients with large tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can be chosen to downstage the tumor for BCS.\nThe management of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) is decided by the status of ALNs at diagnosis and the administration of neoadjuvant systemic therapy. ALND remains the standard in patients with clinically proven axillary involvement at initial diagnosis.8 For patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer, the management of axillary is controversial. There seemed to be comparable recurrence and survival outcomes between ALND and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in the era of contemporary systemic treatments.9 In addition, several prospective trials demonstrated that there was no significance of recurrence and survival between SLN biopsy alone and SLN biopsy plus RT in patients with cN0 and one to two SLN involvement.10–12 Therefore, SLN biopsy might be sufficient for most cN0 patients, and additional axillary radiation only for selected patients, such as patients with three SLN involvement. Further studies are needed to explore the value of ALND, SLN biopsy, and RT in patients with cN0 disease.\nSurgery also plays an important role in the management of local-regional recurrent breast cancer. Total mastectomy remains the standard of care for recurrent patients initially receiving BCS, and salvage mastectomy ± ALND could achieve 85–95% loco-regional control in this disease.8,13 Patients suffering chest-wall recurrence after initial mastectomy had a higher risk of metastasis than those initially treated with BCS.14 In addition, previous studies showed that limited resection was related to a higher second local recurrence of 60–70%; therefore, the routinely recommended management for patients initially treated with mastectomy is wide resection of the recurrent lesions when possible.15,16\nChemotherapy\nThe modalities of chemotherapy in breast cancer include NAC, adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), and salvage chemotherapy. The administration of chemotherapy could reduce the risk of recurrence by approximately 30% in early breast cancer.17 NAC could downstage the breast and axilla for receiving breast conservation in operable breast cancer, convert inoperable breast cancer to resectable, and eliminate micrometastatic lesions. NAC is recommended for patients with a large tumor, multiple ALNs involvement, and aggressive subtypes, especially for triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer.18 The application of NAC in aggressive breast cancer subtypes could evaluate the response to treatment, predict cancer prognosis, and guide subsequent treatment decision-making. Previous studies showed that NAC followed by surgery had similar LRR and survival outcomes compared with surgery followed by chemotherapy, but patients treated with NAC decreased 17% of mastectomy rates.19,20 NAC or AC should be administrated in high-risk patients, such with large tumor size, nodal involvement, low expression of hormone receptor (HR), younger age, and lymphovascular invasion.8 Sandwich chemotherapy should be avoided outside of clinical trials.21 In addition, multigene assays and molecular types could be used to stratify and identify patients who benefit from chemotherapy, especially for node-negative ER-positive, triple-negative, or HER2-positive diseases.22–24\nThe current optimal chemotherapy regimen is taxane with or without anthracycline, given in sequence or combination, both in NAC and AC settings.8 The application of anthracyclines remains controversial, but it seems to be essential in high-risk patients, such as triple-negative and HER-2 positive subtypes.25,26 For patients with TNBC, the addition of platinum to standard regimens (anthracycline and taxane-based regimen) achieved an absolute improvement of pathological complete response (pCR) (15%); however, long-term survival outcomes are less convincing due to the small sample size and short follow-up time.27,28 Another Phase 3 randomized clinical trial including 647 patients explored the value of docetaxel and carboplatin regimens in place of standard regimens in patients with TNBC, and docetaxel and carboplatin showed improved disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse-free survival, but comparable overall survival (OS) compared with standard regimens.29 Therefore, the docetaxel and carboplatin regimen can be used as an alternative to the conventional regimen in the treatment of TNBC. In addition, another Phase III study included 443 patents with early TNBC to assess the effect of low-dose and high-frequency capecitabine maintenance, and result showed that patients receiving capecitabine maintenance had higher 5-year distant disease-free survival (85.8% vs 75.8%, p = 0.02); therefore, low-dose and high-frequency capecitabine maintenance could be used as consolidation therapy in patients receiving standard adjuvant therapy.30,31\nAC is commonly recommended for 3–4 weeks after surgery.32 A population-based study explored the effect of the wider time window, and the authors found that delays beyond 91 days from surgery to the start of AC were related to worse survival, especially in TNBC.33 Therefore, the administration of AC within 3 months after breast surgery is acceptable. With regard to optimal chemotherapy interval, a dose-dense regimen (every 14 days) had better DFS and OS than the conventional interval (every 21 days) in early breast cancer.34\nRadiotherapy\nTwo large-scale randomized trials evaluating the effect of omitting RT in low-risk patients receiving BCS achieved negative results, thus adjuvant RT remains the standard of care for patients receiving BCS.35,36 Whole breast irradiation (WBI) is a convenient option used for adjuvant RT following BCS. Hypofractionated WBI appeared to have comparable local recurrence, survival outcomes, and toxicity profiles compared with WBI.37,38 Therefore, hypofractionated WBI is also supported for early breast cancer not requiring nodal therapy.37,38 In addition, partial breast irradiation (PBI) demonstrated similar local recurrence, but improved cosmetic results and reduced toxicity compared with WBI, thus PBI seemed to be an acceptable alternative for appropriately selected low-risk patients.39,40 Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) is also a treatment option for selected early-stage breast cancer patients receiving BCS with reduced recurrence rates (HR = 4.54, 95% CI: 1.78–11.61, p = 0.002) compared with WBI.41 Brachytherapy also showed a similar breast cancer recurrence rate compared with external radiotherapy (5-year event rate: 4·4%) in the radiation of breast cancer, yet the application of brachytherapy should be cautious due to the lack of sufficient evident data.42\nFor patients receiving mastectomy, whether to irradiate is decided by the number of involved ALNs. Postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is conventionally used in patients with four or more positive ALNs;8 however, the administration of PMRT in patients with one to three involved ALNs remains unclear. Current clinical guidelines strongly recommend PMRT for this patient subset, which is based on the result from the meta-analysis published in Lancet 2014 that PMRT had significantly decreased the LRR rate and cancer-related death.8,43 However, most of the trials enrolled in this meta-analysis were completed before the 1980s, when the RT technique and chemotherapy regimens were much more backward than what it is now, and the LRR rate without PMRT was approximately 30% at that time.43 Several recent studies showed that there seemed no incremental survival benefits in patients with one to three involved ALNs in the era of contemporary systemic treatment.44,45 Therefore, it seems to be essential to select high-risk patients for receiving PMRT, such as younger age, a higher burden of breast and axilla, and biological characteristics. Recent studies demonstrated that the 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathological prognostic staging integrating molecular markers could guide the RT administration in patients with N1 breast cancer.46,47 Further studies are needed to explore the value of PMRT in patients with one to three involved ALNs.\nFor patients with positive regional lymph nodes, there is evidence that chest wall and infra-/supraclavicular regions radiation were beneficial. The MA.20 trial included 1832 patients with LN positive, and randomized to receive breast irradiation with or without full regional nodal irradiation [including internal mammary nodes (IMNs)].48 Ten-year follow-up showed that additional regional nodal irradiation had improved 24% DFS.48 Chest wall and infra-/supraclavicular regions are commonly irradiation areas; however, the value of IMNs radiation remains a debate. Several studies demonstrated improved OS and decreased breast cancer mortality in patients receiving regional nodal irradiation including IMNs, but higher heart and lung toxicities, lymphedema, and non-breast cancer mortality risk were observed.49,50 Another trial evaluated the value of additional IMN irradiation in patients with positive ALNs or central lesions without positive ALNs, and the result showed that there was no survival benefit in any of the groups (10-year OS: 62.6% vs 59.3%, P > 0.5). Therefore, further studies should be conducted to explore the effect of IMN irradiation.51\nEndocrine Therapy\nEndocrine therapy is considered standard as adjuvant therapy for patients with HR-positive (ER or PR staining ≥1%) over the course of 5–10 years. The sensitivity of endocrine therapy is directly associated with the expression of hormone receptors.52 In premenopausal patients, tamoxifen 20 mg per day for 5 years could reduce about 50% recurrence risk in the first 4 years, and over 30% during 5–9 years, and a longer duration of tamoxifen resulted in further reduction of recurrence and breast cancer mortality.53 Another study from the ATLAS trial demonstrated that the administration of 10-year tamoxifen could reduce breast cancer death by 2% (9.6% vs 11.6%) compared with 5-year tamoxifen.54 Therefore, the duration of tamoxifen should be continued for 10 years. For patients with a high risk of relapses, such as those aged ≤35 years or after chemotherapy, ovarian suppression drugs combined with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or tamoxifen had improved DFS, but higher toxicity compared with tamoxifen alone.55,56\nIn postmenopausal patients, tamoxifen or AI monotherapy 5 years or in sequence are both alternative treatment strategies. AI monotherapy 5 years had reduced breast cancer mortality than tamoxifen 5 years, thus AI is preferred as adjuvant therapy, especially in high-risk patients and patients with lobular histology.57,58 However, patients receiving AI therapy had higher rates of bone-related adverse events, such as fractures and osteoporosis; therefore, tamoxifen can be used as an alternative for patients with serious AI-related adverse events. The duration of tamoxifen and AI in postmenopausal patients should be further assessed for the balance of risks and benefits, and multigene assays might be useful in predicting the appropriate duration.59 In addition, the combination of CDK inhibitors and AI could significantly improve DFS in metastatic breast cancer compared with AI alone; therefore, CDK inhibitors plus AI could be an alternative strategy in endocrine-resistant metastatic breast cancer.60 Detailed information is presented in Table 1.\nTable 1.\nRepresentative Studies of Endocrine Therapy for Breast Cancer\n| Author | Patients | Intervention | Outcomes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| EBCTCG group. 201153 | 21,457 | Tamoxifen 5 years vs no adjuvant tamoxifen | Reduced recurrence rates in the first 10 years, no further gain or loss after 10 year |\n| Davies et al 201354 | 12,894 | Tamoxifen 5 years vs tamoxifen 10 years | 10-year tamoxifen could reduce breast cancer death by 2% (9.6% vs 11.6%) |\n| Pagani et al 201455 | 4,690 | Exemestane+ovarian suppression vs tamoxifen+ovarian suppression 5 years | 5 years disease-free survival 91.1% vs 87.3%, P<0.001; 5 year breast cancer specific survival 92.8% vs 88.8% P<0.001 |\n| EBCTCG group. 201557 | 31,920 | Aromatase inhibitor 5 years vs tamoxifen 5 years | 10-year breast cancer mortality: 12.1% vs 14.2%, p=0.009 |\n| Gao et al 202060 | 4200 | CDK4/6 inhibitors +endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) vs endocrine therapy | CDKI plus endocrine therapy had better median progression-free survival (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.54–0.64) |\n| Alba et al 201261 | 95 | Neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs neoadjuvant hormone therapy | The clinical response rate was 66% vs 48%, p=0.075 |\n| Smith et al 200562 | 124 | Neoadjuvant tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole | Anastrozole had similar OR compared with tamoxifen (58% vs 22%, p=0.18) for patients with HER2-positive cancer |\nOpen in a new tab\nThe value of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in early ER-positive breast cancer was unclear. Early studies of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy were focused on elderly postmenopausal patients with locally advanced breast cancer, or unable to receive chemotherapy. The response rate of neoadjuvant tamoxifen was about 50%.63,64 A recent study showed that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy combined with chemotherapy could increase BCS rates in postmenopausal patients with luminal breast cancer.61 Moreover, neoadjuvant anastrozole seemed to have a similar anti-cancer effect compared with tamoxifen.62 AI is more commonly used as neoadjuvant therapy than tamoxifen for better efficacy. Currently, there is no evidence for the optimum duration of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy lacking supporting data. In addition, other ongoing trials use the level of Ki67 after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy to guide the administration of AC.\nTargeted Therapy\nThe appearance of anti-HER2 targeted therapy greatly changed the treatment paradigm and prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab, the first anti-HER2 targeted drug, has been widely used in HER2-positive diseases. American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in 2005 firstly reported the benefit of trastuzumab combined with anthracycline/taxane-based adjuvant therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer. A later study showed that adjuvant trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel had low local-regional and distant recurrences and reduced toxicity in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with tumors ≤2 cm and negative nodes.65 In addition, trastuzumab combined with other chemotherapy regimens (adriamycin/ cyclophosphamide-paclitaxel, docetaxel, and carboplatin) achieved absolute OS advantage.66 Based on the above studies, trastuzumab (1 year) incorporating chemotherapy (adriamycin/cyclophosphamide-paclitaxel, docetaxel, and carboplatin) as neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimens is recommended for patients with HER2-positive disease.8\nOther anti-HER2 drugs, such as pertuzumab and lapatinib, were also assessed in HER-2-positive breast cancer. Recent prospective data showed that additional pertuzumab to trastuzumab plus docetaxel in neoadjuvant therapy could significantly improve pCR compared with trastuzumab plus docetaxel (45·8% vs 29.0%); therefore, neoadjuvant dual-HER2 agents (pertuzumab/trastuzumab) are also an alternative for stage II–III HER2 positive breast cancer.67 Lapatinib seemed to have higher pCR in the neoadjuvant setting, and a recent phase III study showed that paclitaxel combined with trastuzumab plus lapatinib had better RFS and OS compared with paclitaxel plus lapatinib; thus, chemotherapy plus dual HER2-targeting drugs was still a promising treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer.68\nFor metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, anti-HER2 therapy should be used as early as possible, docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab were recommended as first-line standards based on the CLEOPATRA trial.69 Trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) had a significantly prolonged PFS and OS than lapatinib plus capecitabine in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients previously treated with trastuzumab from the EMILIA trial.70 Therefore, lapatinib has been approved for the second-line treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Neratinib is another small molecule of HER1/HER2 inhibitors. The addition of neratinib to capecitabine showed improved PFS and lower central nervous system disease compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine in the phase III NALA trial.71 Another Phase II trial evaluated the value of single-agent neratinib in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, but only 8% response rates were observed; thus, the value of neratinib in metastatic breast cancer should be further assessed.72 Despite the advances in targeted therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer, the resistance to anti-HER2 drugs is still a serious problem and exploring the way to relieve targeted therapy resistance is needed.\nImmunotherapy\nBreast cancer has impaired activated T cell killing of tumor cells due to the presence of inhibitory factors such as interaction between the PD-1, TIM-3, LAG3, TIGIT, CTLA4 and their ligands on the cancer cells promotes T-cell exhaustion and prevents responsiveness to therapy. Therefore, the use of immune checkpoint blockade as an anti-tumor therapy has demonstrated modest single agent activity in advanced breast cancer.73,74\nThe efficacy of single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in metastatic TNBC is low.75–77 KEYNOTE-012 trial evaluated the value of pembrolizumab in pre-treated PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC, and an overall response rate (ORR) of 18.5% was observed.75 KEYNOTE-086 and JAVELIN trials showed an ORR of 21.4% (pembrolizumab) and 5.2% (avelumab), respectively.76,77 The combination of chemotherapy with ICIs demonstrated better results than ICI monotherapy, with an ORR of 26.4–39.4% in 0–2 prior lines of treatment for metastatic TNBC.78,79 IMpassion130, a phase III large-scale randomized trial, included 902 previously untreated, locally advanced, or metastatic TNBC patients, and randomized to receive atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel alone.80 The result showed that patients treated with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel had significantly improved median OS compared with nab-paclitaxel alone.80 However, another study from the IMpassion131 trial achieved a negative result that atezolizumab combined with paclitaxel could not improve survival compared with paclitaxel.81 In addition, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel; paclitaxel; or gemcitabine plus carboplatin) had increased PFS than chemotherapy alone in untreated locally recurrent or metastatic TNBC.82 Therefore, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the first-line treatment of PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC. In addition, in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, pembrolizumab+trastuzumab showed a 15% response rates in PD-L1-positive tumors; however, atezolizumab combined with T-DM1 did not improve PFS but increased toxicity.83,84\nThe value of ICIs plus chemotherapy was also explored in early-stage breast cancer, and preliminary success was observed.85,86 The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) in the neoadjuvant setting of stage II–III breast cancer had higher pCR rates in HER2-negative (44% vs 17%), HR-positive/HER2-negative (30% vs 13%), and triple-negative subtypes (60% vs 22%) than chemotherapy alone.85 KEYNOTE-522 demonstrated that four cycles of pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel/ carboplatin, then four cycles of pembrolizumab plus anthracycline/cyclophosphamide showed improved pCR rates (64.8% vs 51.2%) and event-free survival (91.3% vs 85.3%) compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone in TNBC.86 In addition, neoadjuvant durvalumab plus nab-paclitaxel/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide had an increased pCR rate, especially in patients with durvalumab alone before chemotherapy.87 In Impassion 031 study, atezolizumab combined with nab-paclitaxel+anthracycline also had increased pCR rate (41% vs 58%, p = 0.0044) in TNBC patients.85 However, fewer results were available in luminal and HER2-positive subtypes. A Phase 2 study exploring the effect of pembrolizumab plus neoadjuvant paclitaxel+doxorubicin+cyclophosphamide in HER2-negative patients, and results showed that patients receiving pembrolizumab undergone higher pCR rate (30% vs 13%) in luminal patients.88 Although promising results were observed in neoadjuvant therapy of ICIs plus chemotherapy, longer follow-up data are needed to confirm the long-term efficacy.\nGene Therapy\nGene therapy is also a promising approach in the treatment of cancers, which defined as sending genetic material through a vector into target cells to edit the gene and change the expression of a gene’s product, and achieving the goal of treating cancers.89 Gene therapy strategies include gene editing, targeting transcription factors, microRNA, and breast cancer cells, DNA or RNA vaccination, and so on. A Phase I clinical trials tested the safety and efficacy of genetic prodrug activation therapy targeted the human HER-2 gene promoter. The study included 12 breast cancer patients, and result showed that the approach was safe and targeted gene expression was detected in up to 90% of the patients.90 Another phase 2 trial includes 28 patients with metastatic TNBC to explore the value of in situ virus gene therapy (ADV/HSV-tk) plus stereotactic body radiotherapy and pembrolizumab, and the result demonstrated that clinical benefit rate was 21.4%, and patients with clinical benefit had durable responses, with improved median duration on treatment (9.6 months) and OS (14.7 months).91 Use of microRNA in anti-cancer therapy also showed promising results in inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation and development. MRX34, to our knowledge, is one of the first miRNA replacement agents (miR-34a), and now in entering clinical trials. It is believed that it will play a vital role in the treatment of breast cancer in the future. Currently, few studies on gene therapy were published, but a lot of strategies have entered clinical trials in breast cancer. We summarized several clinical studies on breast cancer gene therapy in Table 2.\nTable 2.\nOngoing Trials of Gene Therapy, Vaccine, and CAR-T Therapy of Breast Cancer\n| Identifier | Patients | Trial phase | Intervention | Endpoints |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NCT00849459 | mBC | Phase 1 | Adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 | Serum antibodies (titer) to adenovirus, toxicity and safety |\n| NCT00880464 | Operable BC | Phase Ib | Vaccination with autologous tumor cells engineered by adenoviral mediated gene transfer to secrete GM-CS | Minimum number of vaccine doses, adverse events |\n| NCT00505271 | R/M BC | Phase I/II | Rexin-G | Clinical toxicity |\n| NCT00673829 | mBC | Phase 1 | Gene modified T Cells and Interleukin 2 | The safety of using modified T-cells, optimal biologic dose of Interleukin 2 |\n| NCT01829971 | TNBC and other cancers | Phase I | MRX34, micro RNA therapy | Maximum tolerated dose for MRX34 |\n| NCT00093834 | mBC | Phase I | Allogeneic GM-CSF-Secreting Breast Cancer Vaccine | Toxicity of vaccine |\n| NCT00784524 | mBC | Phase II | LMI Vaccination + IL-2 | Disease response |\n| NCT04674306 | IIA-IIIC TNBC | Phase I | α-lactalbumin vaccine | Treatment cohort maximum tolerated dose of α-lactalbumin vaccine |\n| NCT04430595 | III–IV BC | Phase I/II | 4SCAR T cells | Number of patients with adverse events |\n| NCT02792114 | mBC | Phase I | Mesothelin-targeted T cells | Maximum tolerated dose |\nOpen in a new tab\nAbbreviations: BC, breast cancer; mBC, metastatic breast cancer; R/M, recurrent/metastatic; TNBC, triple negative breast cancer; CAR-T, chimeric antigen receptor T.\nConclusion and Future Perspectives\nThe value of local and systemic therapies in breast cancer has been well established. For early breast cancer, surgery-based local and systemic treatments are the standard of care. For metastatic breast cancer, chemotherapy-based systemic treatments remain the preferred option, and surgery is only used for palliative therapy in selected patients. However, survival benefits of traditional treatment strategies were limited. The emergence of targeted therapy and immunotherapy further changed the treatment pattern of early and metastatic breast cancer. Atezolizumab or pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy are approved by FDA for the first-line treatment of PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab is approved for early TNBC. Numerous novel ICIs and new ICIs-based combination therapies have entered into clinical trails.\nIn addition, some innovative therapies are being investigated in breast cancer, such as gene therapy, breast cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapies, including T cell receptor therapy and CAR-T therapy, and so on. Several phase I/II clinical trails have demonstrated an preliminary improved outcome, and most of them are still ongoing. We summarize some ongoing clinical studies in Table 2. We believe these new therapeutic strategies will gradually be integrated into clinical treatments.\nDisclosure\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.\nReferences\n\n1.Siegel RL, Miller KD, Wagle NS, Jemal A.

This tumor is rare; therefore, detailed information regarding this tumor is still lacking.\nHere, we report a case of a man in his 20s presenting with left foot pain for about one year. Imaging showed a 2-cm ovoid, cortically based lesion with a lytic defect of the cortex at the fifth metatarsal proximal shaft. Histologically, the lesion presented as an infiltrating proliferation of distinctly myoid-appearing spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and mildly atypical vesicular nuclei. Scant mitoses were identified with no areas of necrosis. Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin expression as well as CD31 and ERG. CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells, and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present.\nOver half of the patients with PMH develop multifocal lesions, often involving several tissue planes; however, distant metastasis is very infrequent. This patient underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the prognosis of these lesions.\nKeywords: solitary lesion, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, indolent, vascular, sarcoma, epithelioid, hemangioendothelioma\nIntroduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is an endothelial neoplasm, mostly indolent and with low-grade malignancy, having several different classifications. The current nomenclature was originally described by Hornick and Fletcher (2011), in which its myoid and epithelioid-like histologic pattern is defined as \"pseudomyogenic\" [1]. It is predominantly found in young adult males, at approximately 30 years of age, and in the distal extremities [1]. This vascular neoplasm is multifocal and can involve the dermis, subcutis, and bone [2]. The multifocality of these tumors tends to involve the same local anatomical regions as the original tumor [3]. This tumor is rare; therefore, investigation for additional detailed information regarding this tumor is warranted.\nCase presentation\nA male in his 20s presented with increasing pain in his left foot for the past year. He had a history of hypertension but had no other medical problems or trauma. A physical exam revealed tenderness over the fifth metatarsal, particularly at the proximal shaft. There was no warmth, erythema, or lymphadenopathy, and a reassuring distal neurovascular exam. Plain X-rays revealed a 2-cm ovoid lytic lesion in the fifth metatarsal, with a saucer-like deformity and significant scalloping, favoring reparative granuloma, chondroma, periosteal desmoid, or other neoplasms (Figure 1). The lesion was also identified on CT and MRI. A biopsy of the lesion was taken at the time of surgery.\nFigure 1.

Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin AE1&3 expression, as well as CD31 and ERG (Figure 3). CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells (Figure 3), and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present.\nFigure 3.

These findings are consistent with an epithelioid sarcoma-like epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), with a differential diagnosis including epithelioid vascular neoplasm and epithelioid sarcoma. The retention of INI1 expression, strong CD31 positivity, and lack of diffuse CD34 argue against epithelioid sarcoma, which was described as PMH.\nThe decision was made to treat the lesion with debridement, curettage, grafting, and internal fixation. Post-surgical follow-up positron emission tomography (PET) scans were negative, and CT scans have shown progressive healing of the pathologic fracture and the cavitating cortical lesion (Figure 4). There was no evidence of recurrent tumor, including local recurrence or local spread to other sites after seven years of follow-up.\nFigure 4.

PMH can be asymptomatic, but the most common symptom is pain in the region of the tumor [4]. It most commonly occurs in the dermis and subcutis tissue layer, yet approximately half of the cases have intramuscular lesions, and 20% are intraosseous [1]. Grossly, 70% of these lesions are multifocal, unlike in this case as a solitary lesion, and average in size between 1 and 2.5 cm [2,5]. It is a mostly indolent tumor with a low likelihood to metastasize, as also demonstrated in this case [1]. The main treatment for PMH is debridement; however, chemotherapy is also used. Targeted angiogenic drugs have been proposed, specifically as a treatment for vascular tumors. Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitor drug in which mTOR is prevented from activating protein synthesis and angiogenesis. Sirolimus (rapamycin) and derivatives have been predicted to be an effective and less toxic treatment compared to chemotherapy for PMH [2].\nHistologic morphology of PMH consists of neoplastic cells that are enlarged, spindled, and with bright eosinophilic cytoplasm that can mimic rhabdomyoblasts. They contain mild nuclear atypia and infrequent mitotic activity [1,6].\nPMH has an inclusive differential diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteoblastoma, and vascular tumors [4]. PMH has presenting similarities with epithelioid sarcomas, such as presenting in the skin and soft tissue in the distal extremities and having diffuse keratin positivity [1]. This case represents the importance of identifying and distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors with poorer prognoses. To differentiate between PMH and epithelioid sarcoma, as both have cytokeratin positivity, epithelioid sarcoma expresses MNF116 and AE1&3 and has a loss of expression of INI1 (90%) and CD34 (50%) [3,7]. PMH is also negative for pan-cytokeratin, EMA, and CD34, in which 50% are positive in epithelioid sarcoma [1,3,7]. Histologically, PMH can mimic other skeletal muscle tumors; however, PMH lacks expression for actin, MyoD1, and desmin [1,6,8]. PMH usually shows reactivity with vascular markers, including CD31, FLI1, and ERG, as well as co-expresses vimentin and keratins such as AE1&3, CK7, and CAM5.2 [6].\nAnother useful tool in the diagnosis of PMH is the use of FOSB immunohistochemistry. The FOSB expression for PMH is strongly positive [9]. The SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusion due to the chromosomal translocation t(7;19)(q22;q13) has been identified in several cases [6,10]. The WHO 2020 classification reported on recently identified genetic alterations in which PMH has SERPINE1-FOSB and ACTB-FOSB, which can be useful when distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors [10]. The differential diagnosis for PMH can be broad, and the rarity emphasizes the importance of immunohistochemical stains and increases the possibility of being overlooked.\nConclusions\nPMH is a rare neoplasm, particularly with the involvement of the bone. It is characterized as a multifocal, male-predominant tumor with predominantly spindled epithelioid morphology and positive keratin markers. We presented a patient who underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the importance of the identification of these lesions and their effects on treatment and prognosis.\nThe content published in Cureus is the result of clinical experience and/or research by independent individuals or organizations.

The results from a robust retrospective cohort study support the use of sirolimus for patients who have multifocal epithelioid hemangioendothelioma without serosal effusion.\nKeywords: chemotherapy, EHE, epitheliod hamangioendothelioma, sarcoma, sirolimus\n\nIn this issue of Cancer, Stacchiotti and colleagues present data from a large retrospective cohort of patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) who were treated with sirolimus. 1 EHE is a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma that was first described in 1982, 2 with the naming representative of intermediate biologic behavior between epithelioid hemangioma and angiosarcoma. 3 Histologically, EHE is characterized by nests and cords of epithelioid endothelial cells in a myxoid matrix. 2 , 3 Before the identification of pathognomonic gene fusions, the diagnosis of EHE was challenging because of the histologic overlap with the spectrum of epithelioid vascular tumors, from benign epithelioid hemangioma to epithelioid angiosarcoma. 4 The molecular hallmark of EHE is 2 fusions—WWTR1‐CAMTA1 4 and TFE3‐YAP1 5 —with CAMTA1 and YAP1 sharing similar protein level functions in the Hippo signaling pathway. 5 The most common is the recurrent chromosomal translocation WWTR1‐CAMTA1 (t[1;3][p36.3;q25]), 4 , 6 which has been described across multiple EHE primary sites and grades. 4 The TFE3‐YAP1 fusion has been reported primarily in young adults. 5\nSimilar to the findings of Stacchiotti et al, published cohorts of patients with EHE are more often women, 3 , 7 , 8 and the median age at diagnosis ranges from 44 to 57 years. 3 , 7 , 8 EHE can develop in any vascular area but most commonly occurs in the lung (15%‐19%), 7 , 9 liver (28%‐34%), 7 , 9 extremity (13%‐65%), 2 , 3 , 6 , 10 head and neck (12%‐21%), 2 , 3 , 6 , 10 trunk (8%‐23%), 2 , 3 , 10 or mediastinum (2%‐8%). 2 , 3 , 10 Most patients present with metastatic disease. 7 , 11 For patients with localized disease, complete surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. A large primary tumor size (>3 cm) and a high mitotic index (>3 mitoses per 50 high‐power fields) have been shown to increase the risk of recurrence and mortality in a retrospective cohort. 3 Although there are multiple case series in the literature, it is difficult to estimate the risk of recurrence given the heterogenous clinical behavior of patients with EHE. Across multiple small studies, the risk of recurrence can range from 21% to 58%, 3 , 6 , 10 , 12 with sites of metastasis including lung, liver, bone, chest wall, peritoneum, and lymph nodes. 6 , 12\nThe natural history of EHE is unpredictable, and there is significant patient variation. Behavior ranges from very indolent disease, with rare cases of spontaneous pulmonary regression, 13 to other patients experiencing rapid disease progression. 14 It has been demonstrated that patients with effusions, either pleural or peritoneal, have worse outcomes. 13 , 15 In a retrospective combined analysis of 75 published cases, pulmonary disease, weight loss, anemia, and pulmonary hemorrhage were correlated with poorer patient outcomes. 15\nThere is very limited literature published related to systemic treatment for EHE. Multidisciplinary input is key given the heterogeneous clinical behavior of EHE. Local treatments should be considered for patients who have indolent disease with oligoprogressing sites. 16 There is biologic rationale for antiangiogenic agents with immunohistochemical analysis from a small cohort of patients with pulmonary EHE who demonstrated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and VEGFR3. 17 However, in retrospective cohorts, mixed efficacy has been reported with antiangiogenic treatments. Sorafenib, thalidomide, and cyclophosphamide have shown limited activity, 11 whereas responses have been reported using celecoxib 7 and pazopanib. 18 Partial responses (PRs) have also been reported with interferon. 7 , 19 The single published phase 2 trial of 15 patients who had EHE treated with sorafenib reported a nonprogression rate of 38.4% and an overall response rate of 7.7%. 8 A single‐arm phase 2 trial of the MEK inhibitor trametinib for patients with unresectable or metastatic EHE is ongoing, with results expected in 2023. 20 The ultrararity of EHE likely precludes any randomized trials, and the evidence backbone for treatment will remain in robust cohort studies. 7 Consequently, the cohort reported by Stacchiotti et al is an important addition to the limited existing literature.\nBuilding on their single‐enter experience, 21 in their current series of 38 patients across 2 Italian sarcoma centers, Stacchiotti and colleagues examine the effect of sirolimus at plasma levels from 15 to 20 ng/dL in patients with progressive EHE. To our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort to date of patients with EHE who received the same systemic therapy. Sirolimus is a natural product originally isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus from Easter Island. 22 Sirolimus forms part of a complex that directly binds and inhibits the function of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which has downstream effects, including cell cycle arrest. 22 In vitro studies have demonstrated that YAP/TAZ, the oncogenic fusions of which are the molecular hallmark of EHE, are involved in activation of mTOR complex 1. 23 This provides biologic rationale for the use of sirolimus in EHE.\nThe authors mandated that patients were required to have clinical or radiologic disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST) before inclusion in the analysis. It is key that this retrospective cohort focuses on a specific, progressing population. This limits heterogeneity, which, in turn, increases the clinical relevance of the results. This cohort is further strengthened by central pathology review and the inclusion of only fusion‐positive (WWTR1 and/or TFE3 rearrangements) cases. The majority of patients had lung involvement (76.3%). The age and the predominance of women in the cohort were similar to expected values based on published literature. 3 , 6 , 7 , 8\nThe median progression‐free survival (mPFS) was 13 months, and the overall survival (mOS) was 18.8 months for the entire cohort. These results are similar to those from the initial cohort of 18 patients. 21 The authors also report results based on the important prognostic feature of serosal effusion. 13 , 15 Congruent with the published literature, 13 , 15 patients without serosal effusions fared significantly better, with an mPFS of 47.8 months (interquartile range, 11.4 months to not evaluated) and an mOS of 47.8 months (interquartile range, 15.7 months to not evaluated), compared with patients who did have serosal effusions (mPFS, 4.8 months; mOS, 10.6 months). Thus the results from the entire population should be interpreted with caution given the differing biologic behaviors observed based on the presence of serosal effusions alone. The extent to which the primary site or location of metastasis, independent of the presence of serosal effusions, affected mPFS and mOS is unknown. Given the heterogeneity across primary sites, location of metastasis, and variable clinical behavior, it is difficult to compare these outcomes with those from other published cohorts of patients who received systemic therapy.\nIn terms of best response, in patients without serosal effusions at baseline, the clinical benefit rate was 88% (PR, 8%; stable disease [SD], 80%) according to RECIST 1.1, compared with 83.3% (PR, 0%; SD, 83.3%) for patients with serosal effusions at baseline. Although the clinical benefit rates were similar for patients with and without serosal effusions, responses were not sustained in patients with serosal effusion, as demonstrated by their much shorter mPFS. At 12 months, only 2 patients (15.3%) with serosal effusions were progression‐free, whereas more than one‐half of patients (62.8%) without serosal effusions were progression‐free at 24 months. Encouragingly, 4 patients who discontinued sirolimus when they were responsive or stable re‐achieved stability with sirolimus re‐challenge. This suggests that treatment breaks may be possible for patients who have long‐term SD, which has important implications for quality of life. However, one must be cautious of overinterpreting response data without parallel information regarding patient symptoms. On the basis of anecdotal observation of patients with extensive EHE, particularly those with pulmonary involvement, treated at The Royal Marsden Hospital, patients may have clinical disease progression without overt changes on imaging. We hypothesize that the mechanism of this discrepancy is poorly understood but may be related to small vessel changes beyond the resolution of conventional imaging. Thus the true response assessment to systemic therapy for EHE may be determined best by using a combination of disease‐related symptoms and imaging rather than based purely on imaging alone. Congruently, the authors rightly highlight that it is challenging to interpret the response in EHE using RECIST 1.1 because the response of serosal effusions is not a part of these criteria, and the development of EHE‐specific response criteria is indicated.\nA significant number of patients required a dose adjustment (42.1%); however, it is not clear why the adjustment was required, although it is likely a combination of side effects and dose titration to a specific plasma level. Relatively few patients discontinued because of toxicities (7.9%), with reported toxicities overall relatively mild, including mucositis, hypercholesterolemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. No patients had unexpected or grade 4 and 5 toxicities. Infections were common (21%), with grade 3 infections reported in 3 patients. Notably, a significant number of women had menstrual alterations, the clinical significance of which is uncertain given that this is a population with incurable disease; however, such symptoms may be distressing for these patients.\nIn total, for this ultrarare sarcoma, the current data represent the best quality evidence to date for use of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus in multifocal EHE. We agree that sirolimus represents a safe and effective treatment option for patients who have EHE without serosal effusions. Outcomes for patients with serosal effusions remain poor, and further thoughtful, multiinstitutional, retrospective cohort studies as well as prospective trials are needed to understand which systemic therapies may be effective for this more aggressive presentation of EHE. In addition, multiinstitutional partnerships focusing on translational work and clinical studies are critical to developing targeted treatments for this ultrarare sarcoma. This approach has implications and relevance for other ultrarare cancers.\nFunding Support\nThis work was supported by The Royal Marsden/Institute of Cancer Research National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Center.

This article aims to study the clinicopathological features of PHE.\nMethods\nWe collected the clinicopathological features of 10 new PHE, and examined their molecular pathological features by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In addition, we summarized and analyzed the pathological data of 189 reported cases.\nResults\nThe case group consisted of six men and four women aged 12–83 years (median: 41 years). Five instances occurred in the limbs, three in the head and neck, and two in the trunk. Tumor tissues were composed of spindle cells and round or polygonal epithelioid cells, which were either arranged in sheets or interwoven, along with areas of transitional morphology. Scattered or patchy stromal neutrophil infiltration was observed. Tumor cells had abundant cytoplasm, and some contained vacuoles. The nuclei had mild to moderate atypia, with visible nucleoli, and mitosis was rare. PHE tissues diffusely expressed CD31 and ERG, but not CD34, Desmin, SOX-10, HHV8 or S100, while some samples expressed CKpan, FLI-1 and EMA. INI-1 stain is retained. The proliferation index of Ki-67 is 10–35%. Seven samples were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization, six of which had breakages in FosB proto-oncogene (AP-1 transcription factor subunit). Two patients experienced recurrence; however, no metastasis or death occurred.\nConclusions\nPHE is a rare soft tissue vascular tumor, which has biologically borderline malignant potential, local recurrence, little metastasis, and good overall survival and prognosis. Immunomarkers and molecular detection are valuable for diagnosis.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13000-023-01309-9.\nKeywords: Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, Clinicopathological features, Immunohistochemistry, Molecular pathology\nIntroduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a newly identified intermediate soft tissue tumor. Although the name was first proposed by Hornick et al_. [1] in 2011, the disease has been discussed for many years. In 1992, Mirra et al. [2] first reported five tumors that were histologically similar to epithelioid sarcoma (ES) but lacked its typical characteristics, and called them “variants of epithelioid sarcoma.” In 2003, Billings et al. [3] reported seven patients with low-grade vascular tumors similar to ES, and put forward the concept of “Epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma” In 2011, Hornick et al._ [1], in the largest PHE study to date, reported 50 new cases, further expanding our understanding of these tumors; they named the condition “pseudomyogenic vascular endothelial tumors” to emphasize their histological muscle-like characteristics. Although the name remains controversial [4], the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified PHE as an intermediate type of soft tissue vascular tumor in 2013 [5].\nPHE is rare. It generally occurs in the limbs of young men, especially in the distal lower limbs, but can also occur in various other tissues, including the oral cavity [6, 7], chest wall [1, 8, 9], breast [10], esophagus [11] and external genitalia [1, 12, 13]. It can involve multiple tissue planes, including the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, bone, and skeletal muscle. It is often multifocal and rarely metastasizes; however, it is prone to local recurrence. In this study, we report 10 cases of PHE and comprehensively summarize the details of previously reported cases, to improve our understanding of PHE.\nMaterials and methods\nCase data and specimen collection\nTissue specimens and clinical data were collected from 10 patients with PHE, including three cases from the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College (Bengbu, China), three from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital (Shanghai, China), two from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (Hefei, China), one from the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China (Hefei, China), and one from Yijishan Hospital (Wuhu, China). All the published literature in PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) was comprehensively searched, using the keywords “pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma” or “epithelioid sarcomatoid hemangioendothelioma,” and repeated case reports were excluded to obtain a non-redundant dataset of cases. In total, there were 189 cases of PHE reported in 59 studies (Supplementary Table 1).\nPathological examination\nHematoxylin–eosin staining reagent was purchased from Beijing Zhongshan Jinqiao Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Antibodies were purchased from Fuzhou Maixin Biotechnology Development Co., Ltd. (Fuzhou, China) (Table 1). Immunohistochemical staining was performed by EnVision's two-step method. The main immunohistochemical markers were CKpan, CD34, CD31, FLI-1, EMA, INI-1, S100, SOX-10, HHV8, Desmin and Ki-67. Two pathologists re-evaluated the sections.\nTable 1.\nAntibodies used in immunohistochemistry and their sources\n| Antibody | Clone number | Monoclonal/Polyclonal | Positive site |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| CK (pan) | MX005 | monoclonal | cytoplasm |\n| CD34 | QBEnd/10 | monoclonal | cell membrane and cytoplasm |\n| CD31 | JC/70A | monoclonal | cell membrane |\n| FLI-1 | MX045 | monoclonal | nucleus |\n| ERG | MXR004 | monoclonal | nucleus |\n| INI-1 | MRQ-27 | monoclonal | nucleus |\n| S100 | 4C4.9 | monoclonal | cytoplasm/nucleus |\n| SOX-10 | EP268 | monoclonal | nucleus |\n| Desmin | D33 | monoclonal | cytoplasm |\n| Vimentin | V9 | monoclonal | cytoplasm |\n| EMA | E29 | monoclonal | cytoplasm/cell membrane |\n| HHV8 | 13B10 | monoclonal | nucleus |\nOpen in a new tab\nFluorescence in situ hybridization\nFOSB (19q13) gene fragment probe reagent, in situ hybridization blue staining solution and related reagents required for in situ hybridization experiment were purchased from Ambiping Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). According to the instructions, 7 PHE cases were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.\nData collection and analysis\nPositive immunohistochemical signals for FLI-1, INI-1, HHV8 and Ki-67 were located in the nucleus, while those for CKpan,and Desmin were observed in the cytoplasm. CD31 was observed in the cell membrane, and CD34 was observed in the cell membrane or cytoplasm. S100 and ERG signals were observed in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining results were scored according to their intensity and range (the percentage of total cancer cells that were stained). The scoring for staining intensity was as follows: colorless, 0 points; pale yellow, 1 point; light brown, 2 points; dark brown, 3 points. The staining range was scored as follows: < 5%, 0 points; 5–25%, 1 point; 26–50%, 2 points; 51–75%, 3 points; > 75%, 4 points. The two scores were then multiplied, and samples scoring 0 points were considered negative; 1–4 points, weakly positive; 5–8 points, moderately positive; 9–12 points, strongly positive. Fluorescence in situ hybridization signals in cancer cell nuclei were observed and quantified under a high-power microscope. A red signal indicated > 10% separation between the number of red and green signals in 50 cells, meaning that the FosB proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (FOSB) gene, was broken and rearranged; with < 10% separation, samples were considered negative.\nPatient follow-up\nThe patients were followed up for 2–55 months through outpatient services and telephone calls. Follow-up data on the 189 previously reported cases were summarized.\nResults\nClinical data\nThe patients included six males and four females, aged 12–83 years, with a median age of 41 years (Table 2). Three cases had the tumor in the lower limbs, three in the head and neck, two in the upper limbs, and two in the trunk. The masses of seven patients were painless, while three patients were treated for painful nodules. Multiple tumors were observed in 5/10 cases. Approximately 25% of PHE cases have bone involvement [1], and among the 10 patients in this group, one was treated for bone tumors in the left knee and one for bone tumors in the left foot. Among the 189 PHE cases screened, 139 were male and 50 were female. Their ages were widely distributed, ranging from 6 to 86 years, with an average age of 34 years. The disease occurred in the limbs, trunk, head, and face, but was concentrated in the limbs (140 cases, 74%), especially in the legs (112 cases, 59%). It was also occasionally detected in the oral cavity, vulva, and breast and often showed multifocal involvement (134 cases, 71%).\nTable 2.\nClinical data from 10 patients\n| Patient number | Sex | Age | Site | Single/\nmultiple\nnodules | Recurrence/\nmetastasis | Treatment | Follow-up (months) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 1 | Female | 51 | neck | Mul | Recurrence | E | 3 |\n| 2 | Male | 21 | forearm | Sin | No | E | 2 |\n| 3 | Female | 22 | foot | Mul | Recurrence | E | 55 |\n| 4 | Female | 83 | Face | Sin | No | E | 13 |\n| 5 | Male | 12 | femur | Mul | Recurrence | E | 18 |\n| 6 | Male | 22 | back | Mul | Recurrence | E + C | 31 |\n| 7 | Male | 32 | arm | Mul | No | E | 12 |\n| 8 | Female | 63 | knee | Sin | No | E | 51 |\n| 9 | Male | 73 | neck | Sin | No | E | 22 |\n| 10 | Male | 70 | neck | Sin | No | E | 18 |\nOpen in a new tab\nAbbreviations__: E Excision, C Chemotherapy, Mul Multiple, Sin Single\nHistopathology and immunohistochemistry\nMacroscopically, the 10 new tumors were 0.7–6.5 cm in diameter and were gray-white or gray-red nodules with unclear boundaries and infiltration. Some tissues were compressed and damaged to some extent. The tumors involved the dermis, subcutaneous tissues, and bones. Microscopically, various proportions of spindle cells and epithelioid cells were observed in the lesions. The spindle cells were arranged in loose strips, bundles, or nodules, and the cells were rich and plump, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and an oval nucleus. Epithelial cells were either round or pleomorphic, and some contained cytoplasmic vacuoles. In some areas, spindle cells and epithelioid endothelial cells could migrate (Fig. 1). Scattered infiltrating inflammatory cells were observed in the stroma, and mitosis was rare, without tumor necrosis or pathological mitosis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that cells in the 10 tumors were diffusely positive for CD31 and ERG but negative for CD34, Desmin, and S100. Some cases were positive for FLI-1, CD56, and CKpan but negative for SMA, S100, HHV8 and SOX-10. INI-1 stain is retained. The proliferation index of Ki-67 is 10–35% (Fig. 2).\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nHistological characteristics of PHE tumors. A The tumor cells grow in nodules (× 40).

Red arrows indicate separation signals\nPrognosis\nDuring 2–55 months of follow-up, four cases recurred after surgery; however, no metastasis or death occurred. Among the 175 previous cases with clinical data, 16 (9%) experienced metastasis, 41 (23%) had recurrences, and 4 died, including 2 from distant metastases, one from squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis at the base of the mouth, and one from an unknown cause. The remaining cases were cured either after initial treatment or after one or more recurrences.\nDiscussion\nPHE is a rare, low-grade, malignant, soft tissue tumor, officially named by the WHO in 2013, and is classified as a vascular tumor subtype [5]. Currently, less than 200 cases have been reported in the literature, primarily in case reports. PHE is common in the distal extremities of young men, especially in the lower limbs, and is often multifocal and involves multiple tissue planes. Some patients suffer from pain, and while the tumors rarely metastasize, they easily recur locally, requiring close clinical follow-up.\nMacroscopically, PHE has unclear boundaries and appears as gray-white or gray-red nodules in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, with diameters ranging from several millimeters to several centimeters. Microscopically, the centers of PHE lesions are composed of plump fusiform cells and round epithelioid cells loosely arranged in sheets or bundles. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic, similar to rhabdomyoblasts. Infiltration of neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells can usually be observed in stroma. During early pathological changes, slight cell atypia is often observed; the nucleoli are small and not obvious, and mitosis is rare. In recurrent lesions, cell atypia is more obvious, with different nuclear sizes, prominent nucleoli, chromatin aggregation, and pathological mitosis [2]. Tumors often infiltrate surrounding soft tissues, such as the adipose tissue and muscle tissue. Among the 189 PHE cases reported in the past, tumors were reported in the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and bones. Of the 50 PHE cases reported by Hornick et al_. [1], 32 involved multiple tissue planes and the tumor edges showed infiltration. Most tumor cells were spindle cells, with a few epithelioid cells, and most tumors showed mild atypia. Billings et al._ [3] observed intracytoplasmic vacuoles in four of seven PHE cases. Our 10 cases also involved the subcutaneous and bone tissue planes. Morphologically, fat spindle cells and rounded epithelial cells were observed, with no obvious cell atypia. Some tumor cells had a big cytoplasm and were eosinophilic, similar to rhabdomyoblasts; however, no vascular differentiation was observed. Because there is little or no obvious evidence of vascular differentiation in PHE histology, it is very difficult to diagnose the disease in this manner, and immunohistochemistry is crucial. PHE usually strongly expresses CKpan, while CD31 and ERG are expressed to different degrees. CD31, with membrane positivity and linear staining, is a characteristic immunohistochemical marker of PHE. CD34, Desmin, and S100 are not expressed, while FLI-1 is partially expressed, INI-1stain is always retained [3]. In our 10 PHE cases, CD31 and ERG were diffusely expressed, but CD34, Desmin, HHV8 and S100 were not, and some cases expressed CKpan and FLI-1, INI-1 stain is retained.\nThree fusion genes have been detected in PHE: actin-beta (ACTB)-FOSB, WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1)-FOSB, and serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1)-FOSB. Among these, ACTB-FOSB and SERPINE1-FOSB are the characteristic genetic manifestations of PHE, as they are frequently detected, playing important roles in diagnosis [14]. In this group, seven patients with PHE were tested for FOSB cleavage and six were positive. One sample was negative; however, this may have been due to insufficient amounts of tissue for analysis.\nSoft tissue tumors are widely distributed; there are many types, but all have similar structures and cell morphologies. Proper differential diagnosis is important for their treatment and therefore has clinical significance. Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) is a malignant mesenchymal tumor with an epithelioid morphology and phenotype. Apart from obvious central necrosis and more atypia, ES is very similar to PHE in clinical and histological features, and immunohistochemistry has become an important means of distinguishing between the two conditions. ES simultaneously expresses epithelial markers, such as EMA and CKpan, but does not express CD31 and FLI-1 [15]. In recent years, a lack of INI-1 expression has been identified as a specific marker for ES [16, 17], making the combined detection of INI-1, CD31, and FLI-1 helpful in distinguishing ES and PHE. Epithelial hemangioendothelioma (EH) is a central malignant vascular tumor. Unlike PHE, EH is more common in women and comprises epithelial-like endothelial cells arranged in bundles, with obvious cytoplasmic vacuolation and a stroma filled with transparent mucus. Classical EH expresses ERG, CD31, CD34, and FLI-1, while PHE usually does not express CD34. In recent years, the t(1;3)(q36;q25) chromosomal translocation, which combines the calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 gene and WWTR1, has become regarded as a characteristic genetic manifestation of EH. Being a malignant tumor, the metastasis rate of EH is as high as 20–30%, and the prognosis is worse than that of PHE. Epithelioid angiosarcoma (EA) is a highly malignant tumor with obvious malignant tumor cell characteristics, such as poor differentiation, obvious atypia, and frequent mitosis. It is prone to local recurrence and metastasis in a short time. Compared to PHE, the tumor cell atypia of EA is more obvious, the nuclear division is more common, and tumor tissue often bleed and die. In most cases, anastomotic vascular cavities can be seen. Regarding immunohistochemistry, unlike in PHE, CD31 and FLI-1 are usually negative in EA, while CD34 is partially positive.\nPHE is a type of vascular tumor that easily recurs locally but rarely metastasizes. Most patients with PHE to date have only required tumor resection, while a few underwent extensive resection or even amputation, along with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. All 10 of our cases were resected, and two also received chemotherapy. Among 173 PHE patients with clinical data, 138 (80%) underwent surgical resection and 15 (8.67%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressants. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the use of mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) inhibitors in PHE treatment [18–21]. mTOR activity is inhibited by rapamycin, which exerts antitumor effects by inhibiting proliferation and cell cycle progression. For patients with PHE who experience either adverse effects after radiotherapy and chemotherapy or metastasis, clinical symptoms improve after treatment with mTOR inhibitors. David et al_. [22] studied the effect of the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion protein on endothelial cell function and its interaction with telatinib and suggested that telatinib may be a highly specific targeted treatment option for patients with PHE who are ineligible for surgery. Davis et al._ [23] described a multifocal case of PHE involving both bone and soft tissues and proposed a treatment strategy using radiofrequency ablation and extensive resection for the bone and soft tissue lesions, respectively. These new therapeutic strategies provide new PHE treatment options; however, they are all case reports and will require verification with more cases.\nIn conclusion, PHE is a rare intermediate soft-tissue tumor with inert biological behavior, which often recurs but only occasionally metastasizes. Because of its lack of specific morphological features, it is easily misdiagnosed based solely on histomorphology. However, PHE exhibits characteristic immunohistochemical markers and molecular changes, which play extremely important roles in its diagnosis. To date, less than 200 cases of PHE have been reported worldwide. As more cases are reported in the future, our understanding of PHE will deepen.\nSupplementary Information\n13000_2023_1309_MOESM1_ESM.docx (34.7KB, docx)Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 1.

PHE typically has a multifocal presentation and can involve several tissue planes, including the dermis, subcutis, muscle and bone.\nMethods and results\nWe present here a unique case of PHE/ESH that arose in the breast as well as a review of the published literature. The initial biopsy was interpreted as a metaplastic carcinoma. However, complete resection largely revealed plump epithelioid cells, and a more spindled cell component was also noted. The cells displayed abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and central vesicular nuclei arranged in loose fascicles, with a mild, mixed acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Overall, linear membranous staining of CD31 and lack of CD34 expression were highly suggestive of PHE. At the same time, FOSB immunoreactivity was observed, which supported PHE/ESH instead of metaplastic carcinoma. The patient has not shown recurrence in the half year follow up after total mastectomy.\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of breast involvement in this neoplasm. Recognition of its histopathological features and immunohistochemical reactivity will prevent misdiagnosis of breast lesions.\nKeywords: Breast, Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, Epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, CD31\nBackground\nIn 2013, Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE)/epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma (ES-H) has been accepted as a new vascular fumor entity by WHO. PHE/ESH is a distinct, uncommon tumor with an endothelial phenotype that usually arises in soft tissue, and its biological behavior is intermediate between a benign hemangioma and a fully malignant angiosarcoma [1]. Histologically, PHE/ESH is characterized by ill-defined nodules of plump spindle and epithelioid cells with abundant densely eosinophilic cytoplasm that grow in sheets and fascicles [2]. PHE/ESH has no distinctive clinical features and is difficult to diagnose pathologically, especially when there is no architectural evidence suggestive of endothelial differentiation. At the same time, its vascular differentiation is essentially inapparent, with no well-formed vessels and only rare intracytoplasmic lumens, which makes this tumor type extremely difficult to diagnose. Approximately half of the patients in the largest published series were clinically misdiagnosed with other pathologies [3]. Therefore, increased awareness of this new entity is essential for both clinicians and pathologists.\nIn this article, we describe a rare case of PHE/ES-H of the breast first misdiagnosed as metaplastic carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first case of PHE/ESH in breast. The present study demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma due to an exceedingly unusual location of PHE/ESH appearing as breast metaplastic carcinoma.\nCase presentation\nIn July 2018, a 43-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with the complaint of a mass and pain in her left breast. No significant signs were observed in her past medical and family histories. MRI revealed several masses on her left nipple, the lateral quadrant of the left breast, and the outer upper quadrant of the left breast. No palpable mass was detected in the other breast or axillae. Hence, a tru-cut biopsy was performed.\nThe biopsy pathology revealed a solid, deep dermal and superficial subcutaneous mass consisting of relatively bland spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and moderately enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei. Atypia and mitotic figures were inconspicuous. Acute and chronic inflammatory cells were present throughout the lesion; in particular, the stroma contained prominent neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 1a).\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nMicrophotograph of tumor tissue by FANB. a. Loose fascicles of bland spindle cells with neutrophils scattered in the stroma (H&E, 200x). b. Rhabdomyoblast-like appearance of tumor cells with brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm (H&E, 200x). c. Strong extensive expression of AE1/AE3 in the neoplastic cells (200x). D.CD 34 were negative in tumor cells (200x)\nThe cells of interest were immunoreactive for AE1/AE3 (AE1/AE3, dilution 1:400; Gene Tech) and negative for SMA (1A4, dilution 1:1600; Gene Tech), Desmin (D33, dilution 1:200; Gene Tech), CD34 (QBEnd10, dilution 1:800; Gene Tech), ALK1 (ALK1, dilution 1:200; DAKO), S100 (2A10, dilution 1:400; IBL), β-catenin (E247, dilution 1:400; Gene Tech), and P63 (4A4, dilution 1:1000; Gene Tech). The Ki-67 (MIB-1, dilution 1:30; Biogenex) score demonstrated a low proliferation rate of tumor cells (1/10 HPF). The initial diagnosis was metaplastic carcinoma of the breast with no lymph node metastasis. Biomarker assessment revealed a triple-negative status. ER (SP1, dilution 1:1; Roche), PR (1E2, dilution 1:1; Roche) and c-erb-B2 (4b5, dilution 1:500; Ventana) were all negative. Total mastectomy was performed. The pathology was essentially the same as in the previous study, except for focal myxoid changes in the matrix. Moreover, the tumor cells exhibited a prominent epithelioid cytomorphology with a striking resemblance to rhabdomyoblasts (Fig. 1b). Therefore, more immunohistochemical analyses were performed, including for CD31 (JC70A, dilution 1:400; Gene Tech), FLi-1 (MRQ-1, dilution 1:100; ZATA), ERG (EPR3864, dilution 1:200; ZATA), INI-1 (25, dilution 1:200; ZATA), and FOSB (5G4, dilution 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology) (Fig. 2). AE1/AE3 analysis was repeated. The tumor cells were strongly and diffusely positive for AE1/AE3, FLi-1, ERG and FOSB. In situ hybridization for TFE3 (Z-2109-50; ZytoVision) and c-Myc (05 J91–001; Abbott-Vysis) was also performed. Most of the cells were also positive for CD31, with a linear membranous pattern. The neoplastic cells maintained intact expression of INI-1. FISH results were negative for c-Myc amplification and for TFE3 translocation_,_ which ruled out epithelioid angiosarcoma (EAS) and epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHEs). This immunophenotype supported the vascular nature of the neoplasm in tissue and the final diagnosis of PHE/ESH was made. Furthermore, tumor cell embolus and multiple lesions were found, and lactation surgery was not considered (Fig. 3).\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nImmunohistochemical panel performed on the total mastectomy material.

[4] firstly described five cases of an unusual multifocal soft tissue tumor and called the unique lesions as “the Fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma”, describing it as a “fibrohistiocytic/myoid cell lesion often confused with benign and malignant spindle cell tumors”. In 2003, Billings et al. [3] described seven distinct cases of a low-grade vascular tumor and proposed renaming this tumor “epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma”, which was based on the presence of large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm upon microscopy with keratin positivity. Based on a series of 50 patients and the advent of newer immunohistochemical markers, Hornick and Fletcher [5–7] subsequently proposed changing the terminology to PHE/ESH, confirming its vascular origin and indolent behavior. In 2013, the current World Health Organization classification of soft tissue and bone listed PHE/ESH as an intermediate, rarely metastasizing, vascular tumor with peculiar clinical and pathological features [8].\nIn general, this neoplasm appears to be more common in males than in females (4.6:1) and typically occurs in men between 20 and 50 years of age. Clinically, PHE/ESH most commonly presents as multiple nodules in one anatomic region involving the soft tissues of the upper and lower extremities, but lesions may also arise in the trunk, spine, head, neck, bone and oral cavity [9–13]. Our patient is the first reported case of PHE presenting in the breast. There were several lesions on the nipple of the left breast, the lateral quadrant of the left breast, and the outer upper quadrant of the left breast. Histopathologically, PHE/ESH resembles a neoplasm with ill-defined nodules of plump spindle-shaped and epithelioid cells with abundant densely eosinophilic cytoplasm that grow in sheets and fascicles, sometimes mimicking rhabdomyoblasts. This infiltrative tumor often has a stromal neutrophilic infiltrate and sometimes also has a focal myxoid change in the matrix. Unlike other vascular tumors, PHE/ESH lacks multicellular vascular channels or intralesional hemorrhage. Cytologic atypia is typically mild to moderate, though rare cases have exhibited severe atypia. Mitotic activity is low, with most tumors having fewer than 5 mitoses per 50 HPFs or a mean mitotic rate of 2/10 HPFs [13]. Our case had a mean mitotic rate of 1/10 HPFs. The neoplastic cells usually express cytokeratin AE1/AE3, FLI-1, ERG and are negative for Desmin and S100. Furthermore, CD34 negativity is observed, which differentiates it from other vascular tumors such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma or epithelioid angiosarcoma. Most notably, the tumor cells in our case were also positive for CD31, with linear membranous staining, which may facilitate diagnosis. Recently, the specific balanced translocation t (7; 19) (q22; q13) resulting in the fusion of the SERPINE1 and FOSB genes was reported. This SERPINE1- FOSB gene fusion might lead to strong expression of FOSB, and identification of this genetic derangement is useful for diagnostic purposes [14, 15]. In our case, the tumor cells expressed CD31, AE1/AE3, FLi-1, and ERG and were negative for CD34. More importantly, FOSB overexpression was observed, which is consistent with the literature.\nOncologists are becoming more aware of PHE/ESH. However, it is still easily misdiagnosed. In fact, approximately half of the patients in the largest published series were clinically diagnosed with various other pathologies [6], such as epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and EHE. These three tumors are particularly aggressive, and it is thus important to distinguish PHE. In general, ES, EHE and PHE share certain features: they all affect the young, show epithelioid and spindle cell morphology, and express FLI1 and ERG to varying degrees. PHE/ESH always has a neutrophil background, whereas the other two tumors are negative. Except for the immunophenotypic overlap, ES typically lacks reactivity for CD31 and lacks SMARCB1 (INI-1) expression, unlike PHE/ESH. The WWTR1-CAMTA1 mutation is found in EHE, which is absent in PHE/ESH. Additionally, leiomyosarcoma shows reactivity to Desmin, Actin and Myogenin, but vascular markers are not expressed.\nConsidering all spindle cell lesions occurring in the soft tissues can occur in the breast with overlapping morphologies for different category of lesions so it is important to consider a wide differential diagnosis. In our case, it is easily to rule out diagnoses of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), aggressive fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis (NF), solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), since it is negative for ALK (5A4), β-catenin, SMA, Desmin, and CD34. But one of the most important differential diagnoses is metaplastic carcinoma. Our case was first misdiagnosed as metaplastic carcinoma because of its specific location and its immunochemical panel. Moreover, PHE/ESH has no unique radiological, the exact diagnosis can only be made on histopathologic examination. Neither fine-needle aspiration cytology nor core needle biopsy easily diagnoses PHE/ESH because it is difficult to obtain representative cells for a correct diagnosis by these techniques [16]. Histologically, both tumors share the same features, such as many spindle cells, mild to moderate nuclear atypia, and mitoses, with diffuse expression of keratins and lacking expression of ER, PR, and c-erb-B2. Metaplastic carcinoma, especially spindle cell carcinoma is characterized by atypical spindle cells, arranged in a multitude of architectural patterns raging from long fascicles in herringbone or interwoven patterns to short fascicles in a storiform pattern [17]. Infammatory infiltrate is often found in a proportion of cases, but usually with lymphocytes and dendritic cells not neutrophils. Clearly, vascular markers are not expressed in metaplastic carcinoma. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is not difficult if we are aware of this rare clinical entity in the breast.\nPHE/ESH is a locally recurrent, rarely metastasizing tumor. A total of 82 patients with PHE/ESH have been reported, with follow-up available for 61 (74%); only 3 patients (5%) developed distant metastasis at 4, 8.5 and 16 years after the initial diagnosis. Almost half of patients had local recurrence or new lesions in the same region as the initial tumor, especially in the first year after diagnosis [18]. The efficacy of treatment is only partially known and still the object of study. Surgical excision is the first therapeutic choice for PHE/ESH, followed by chemotherapy or radiation. Most cases can be treated with wide local excision; however, amputation may be recommended for patients with extensive multifocal disease. Moreover, over one-third of patients exhibit relapse after surgery [19]. Based on this, systemic treatment is most likely necessary. Regardless, there are no guidelines because PHE/ESH is so rare. Different systemic therapies (Table 1) have been described in case reports in the literature. Among them, inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) show major efficiency [1, 11–13, 20, 21] in cases of progressive metastatic and relapsing multifocal PHE/ESH resistant to multiagent chemotherapy. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase regulated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), acts as a master switch for numerous cellular processes, such as cellular catabolism and anabolism, motility, angiogenesis and growth. Several members of the PI3K/mTOR pathway have been implicated in the generation and propagation of vascular anomalies. As inhibitors of mTOR target protein synthesis downstream of the Akt pathway, they are predicted to be effective in disorders in which mTOR pathway-mediated growth control is affected. PHE/ESH is associated with the specific translocation t (7; 19) involving the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion gene. SERPINE1 encodes a serine protease inhibitor family protein, known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which is reported to inhibit apoptosis by activating the Akt pathway [22]. Akt functions just upstream of mTOR and is overexpressed in endothelial cells of murine models of cutaneous vascular malformations. Therefore, inhibition of mTOR might constitute a target for therapy in the future.

The etiopathogenesis of KHE is still poorly understood. In the present study, we found a new mutation in KHE (c.685delA, p.Thr229fs). The KHE patient with the PIK3CA mutation showed complete regression after sirolimus treatment. We propose that the presence of the PIK3CA mutation in KHE may correlate with good response to sirolimus.\nKeywords: PIK3CA, mutation, sirolimus, Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, mTOR\nIntroduction\nKaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) is an extremely rare, locally aggressive vascular neoplasm resulting from abnormal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis during infancy or early childhood. It is commonly complicated by the occurrence of the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, which is characterized by the association of a rapidly growing vascular tumor, thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy (1). Recently, Carli et al. reported a patient with KHE with a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation (c.323G > A, p.Arg108His) and suggested that KHE may be a subtype of PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) (2). PROS is defined as a phenotypic spectrum of developmental disorders caused by activating variants of the PIK3CA gene (3). In the present study, we found a different PIK3CA mutation in KHE (c.685delA, p.Thr229fs), which provides new evidence that KHE may belongs to PROS.\nCase report\nA 3-month-old boy was referred to Children’s hospital of Fudan university with a middorsal tumor growing for more than one month, which was misdiagnosed as hemangioma and received no treatment by the local hospital. Physical examination revealed an erythematous, poorly demarcated lesion (6 cm × 5 cm) on the patient’s back with no signs of inflammation or pain (\nFigure 1A\n). The patient had no family history of vascular disorders.\nFigure 1.\n\n\n(A) Before treatment, an erythematous, poorly demarcated lesion (6 cm x 5 cm) on the back. (B) After two years of sirolimus treatment, the lesion regressed completely.\nLaboratory examination found no obvious abnormality in routine blood and coagulation tests. Complete blood count at presentation revealed a platelet count of 302 × 109/L (normal range:188-472× 109/L) and hemoglobin level of 13.8 g/dl(normal range:11.2-14.9 g/dl). Coagulation function was normal including fibrinogen 209 mg/dl(normal range: 200-400 mg/dl), prothrombin time 13.3 s(normal range:11-14.5s), partial thromboplastin time 34 s (normal range:28-45s)and D-dimer level 1.99 mg/L (normal range: 0-0.5 mg/L).\nMagnetic resonance imaging showed ill-defined margins and diffusive hyperintense signals in fat-suppressed T2 weighted images (\nFigures 2A, B\n) and obvious heterogeneous enhancement in T1 weighted images.\nFigure 2.\n\n\n(A, B) Magnetic resonance imaging showed ill-defined margins, diffusive hyperintense signals on fat-suppressed T2 weighted images (black arrow designates the lesion). (C, D) After one year of sirolimus treatment, the lesion shrank dramatically (black arrow designates the lesion). (E, F) After two years of sirolimus treatment, the lesion regressed completely.\nThe patient underwent biopsy that confirmed the pathological diagnosis of KHE. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed typical glomeruloid areas with spindle shaped cells. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for D2–40, PROX-1, LYVE-1, CD31 and CD34 (\nFigure 3\n). We also detected the extracted DNA in tumor tissue samples from biopsy by next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. We focused on hot-spot mutation regions of 42 genes (\nTable 1\n) related to tumorigenesis and vascular diseases and found that the patient harbored PIK3CA mosaic pathogenic variants (c.685delA and p.Thr229fs).\nFigure 3.\n\n\n(A) Typical glomeruloid areas with spindle shaped cells following hematoxylin and eosin staining. (B–F) Immunohistochemical staining was positive for D2–40, PROX-1, LYVE-1, CD31 and CD34, respectively.\nTable 1.\nPanel of 42 genes with mutations related to tumorigenesis and vascular diseases.\nThe patient received sirolimus therapy following diagnosis of KHE without the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon. We administered the sirolimus regimen at an initial dose of 0.8 mg/m2, twice a day and maintained a drug trough level of 10-15 ng/mL (4). Sulfamethoxazole was then applied for prophylaxis of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The lesion shrank dramatically after one year of sirolimus therapy (Figures 2C, D). The patient achieved complete response after two years of sirolimus treatment (Figures 1B, 2E, F). The lesion showed total regression, and no serious complications were observed.\nDiscussion\nThe etiopathogenesis of KHE is still poorly understood. Sporadic vascular tumors have been documented with potential genetic anomalies. Most mutations are detected in genes that play crucial roles in pathways involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, vascular cell growth, apoptosis and proliferation (5). There are no treatment guidelines for KHE, although there are some expert consensus (6) and treatment recommendations (7). Sirolimus (8), vincristine (9) and glucocorticoids (6) are the common medication regimens for KHE.\nA few mutations and genes had been found to be related to the development of KHE. Zhou et al. demonstrated a somatic translocation between chromosomes 13 and 16 at the bands of 13q14 and 16p13.3 in 10% of cells with KHE nodules; normal cells were also present in the karyotype (10). Lim et al. identified a single heterozygous somatic single nucleotide variation, c.614A>T (p.Gln205Leu), in GNA14 (G-protein subunit alpha 14) in one of three KHE patients (11). They subsequently confirmed that somatic activation of the GNA14 mutation caused changes in cellular morphology and rendered cells growth-factor independent by upregulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. A recent study also revealed that PIK3CA mutations correlated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway expression (12), but not with clinical or pathological features, in patients with fibro-adipose vascular anomaly (13), indicating that sirolimus may still be effective in patients without PIK3CA mutations. Sirolimus inhibits the mTOR pathway, with subsequent effects on angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Maruani et al. reported that inhibiting mTOR may help shrink lesions and improve clinical symptoms associated with lymphatic anomalies, even with no evidence of PIK3CA variants (14). We analyzed the expression of mTOR-related proteins in KHE and found that the absence of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and phosphatase and tensin homolog caused abnormal activation of the mTOR signaling pathway and may account for the pathogenesis of KHE (15). In our study, the patient with a new PIK3CA mutation showed complete response to sirolimus therapy. The PIK3CA mutation may have abnormally activated the mTOR pathway, although the pathogenicity of this mutation has not been confirmed. In our next study, we will construct the mutant gene in zebrafish to observe the phenotype of the PIK3CA mutation.\nThe patient is still in maintenance treatment using a lower concentration of sirolimus. At present the standard for sirolimus withdrawal is still controversial, since the rebound of KHE after sirolimus treatment has been reported in approximately 17% of patients (16). Additionally, Venot et al. provided the first direct evidence supporting PIK3CA inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with PROS (17) by inhibiting the constitutively activated p110α subunit of PI3K using targeted molecules, such as BYL719 (Alpelisib) (18). They also proposed new ideas for the treatment of KHE, especially for KHE patients with PIK3CA mutations that show a poor response to existing treatment options.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a new PIK3CA mutation (c.685delA, p.Thr229fs) in KHE. KHE with this PIK3CA mutation may be correlated with a good response to sirolimus. However, more cases are required to validate our findings.\nData availability statement\nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

The aim of this study was to present a rare case of PHE in the back and to review its clinicopathological features, therapeutic modalities, evolutionary aspects and prognosis.\nCase presentation\nWe report the case of a 21-year-old man who consulted for a multinodular mass at the scapula level, that increased in size within 2 months. An excisional surgery was performed. Macroscopic examination showed ulcerated centimetric nodules with a crusty surface. Microscopic examination showed a multinodular proliferation arranged in clusters, made of spindle cells or epithelioid cells with variable atypia. Immunohistochemical study showed the expression ofAE1-AE3, ERG and INI-1. There was no staining for EMA, CD34, and CD-31.

Distant metastases have also been reported. Microscopically, PHE resembles a myoid tumor or epithelioid sarcoma because of the abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and cell shape. Tumor cells express cytokeratin and inconsistently CD34 and CD31. Hence the need to complete the study of ERG and INI1 expression in all soft tissue epithelioid tumors. The translocation t(7;19)(q22; q13) as well as the expression of FOSB in immunohistochemistry allow to differentiate with epithelioid sarcoma.

Introduction\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE), a rare and recently discovered endothelial tumor, was formerly known as a fibroma-like variant of epithelioid sarcoma due to its physical resemblance to that tumor. PHE is an infrequently metastasizing intermediate-grade tumor, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2020 [1]. Young adults, particularly males, are often found to have PHE [2]. Although it can occur anywhere, this tumor often affects the extremities, mainly the lower limbs. The case of a young man diagnosed with PHE in the back reported here emphasizes the importance of a proper differential diagnosis in order to protect individuals whose PHE can be confused for more aggressive sarcomas. The aim of this study was to review clinicopathological features, emphasize on differential diagnosis and discuss therapeutic modalities and prognosis of this rare entity.\n2. Case presentation\nA 21-year-old man with no past medical or trauma history consulted for a back, at the scapula level, multinodular mass that increased rapidly in size within 2 months. A wide excision surgery was performed. Macroscopic examination of the skin specimen showed multiple ulcerated centimetric nodules with a crusty surface. Microscopic examination showed a multinodular proliferation arranged in clusters sometimes delimiting slits. It was made of spindle cells or epithelioid cells with brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm sometimes mimicking rhabdomyoblasts (Fig. 1). Tumor cells contained a nucleated nuclei with variable atypia. Mitotic figures were rarely observed without any atypical mitotic figure. No necrosis was noticed. The tumor ulcerated the epidermis, proliferated throughout the dermis, subcutaneous fat tissue and infiltrated the skeletal muscle in depth. The immunohistochemical study showed the expression of Cytokeratin (AE1-AE3) (Fig. 2), and INI-1. No staining for EMA, CD34 (Fig. 3), CD-31, PS-100 and Desmin was observed. ERG was positive in tumor cells (Fig. 4). The tumor was completely resected with safe margin status. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PHE was retained. A thoraco-abdominal pelvic scan was performed and showed no distant localization. No recurrence was observed six months after the resection. The patient will be followed every 6 months for 4 years with complete clinical examination.\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nHematoxylin and Eosin staining of a pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma.\nA: Tumor arranged in clusters composed of a mix of spindle and epithelioid cells (×100).\nB: Epithelioid and tumor cells showing mild nuclear atypia and rare mitosis (×400).\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells showing an intense and diffuse positivity for keratin AE1/AE3 (×400).\nFig. 3.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells negative for CD34 with positive internal control (×400).\nFig. 4.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTumor cells positive for ERG (×400).\nThe work has been reported in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria [3].\n3. Discussion\nSeveral publications have reported on the clinical and pathological features of PHE. Males are more likely than females to develop the tumor [2] and young adults in the third or early fourth decade have the highest incidence rates [2], [4]. In 60 % of the cases, it affects the lower body; the upper body and trunk are less frequently affected [5]. In our case, the lesion involved the back.\nPatients with PHE may present with pain in half of the cases or may be asymptomatic [5]. Our patient consulted for a back mass that increased in size rapidly.\nPHE can be multifocal, affecting several tissue planes in about two thirds of patients. Most patient's lesions are in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Tumor size ranges from a few millimeters to a few centimeters for PHE. Superficial lesions can manifest as ulcerated nodules mimicking an epithelioid sarcoma [6] or a dermatofibroma [7]. In our case, the lesion was centimetric and presented as nodules with a crusty surface.\nMicroscopically, the tumor's histological architecture is vaguely nodular, and it occasionally exhibits a desmoplastic reaction as it infiltrates the adipose or skeletal muscle tissue around it. The tumor cells are organized in sheets or short fascicles within a background of inflammatory infiltrates that vary in prominence and are typically made up of neutrophils, or less frequently, lymphocytes, plasma cells, or eosinophils. In exceptional cases, a myxoid background is observed. Tumor cells range from spindle to round and epithelioid. Transitional forms have been described [2]. Rhabdomyoblast-like cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei can be found in some areas. Regardless of the morphology, the cells usually feature a highly eosinophilic cytoplasm, bland nuclei with fine chromatin, and variably discernible nucleoli. Most cases of nuclear pleomorphism are mild to moderate; a few cases exhibit significant nuclear atypia. Typically, there are fewer than 5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields, although there have been certain cases where there have been more mitoses. Intratumoral hemorrhage or the development of vascular channels are often absent in the tumor. Geographic necrosis, a hallmark of epithelioid sarcoma, is uncommon. A few intracytoplasmic vacuoles suggestive of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma may occasionally be seen in rare situations [8].\nAlthough PHE expresses vascular immunohistochemistry antibodies, conventional hematoxylin-eosin examinations may not often show morphologic signs of vascular differentiation, and more researches are required to validate endothelial differentiation.\nPHE stains for Cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), ERG, FLI1, and FOSB [2], [9], [10]. Hornick et al. [2] reported that 22/47 cases expressed CD31. In some cases, it is possible to see focal staining for epithelial membrane antigen and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Importantly, integrase interactor 1 (INI-1) exhibits complete nuclear expression within every case. In this study, tumor cells expressed Cytokeratin (AE1-AE3), ERG and INI-1 and were negative for EMA, CD34, and CD-31 which is in accordance to literature.\nOn a molecular level, a balanced t(7;19)(q22;q13) translocation resulting in the fusion of the SERPINE1 and FOSB genes was discovered by Walther et al. [11] who employed cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, messenger RNA sequencing, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Fos family, which also includes the smaller splice variants Fra-1 and Fra-2, dimerizes with Jun proteins to form the AP-1 transcriptional factor complex, which includes FOSB. This family is associated with the occurrence of several malignancies, including colorectal, endometrial, and breast tumors [12]. Since SERPINE1 is thought to be a FOSB promoter and this translocation is exclusive to soft tissue tumors, it is thought to be pathognomonic for PHE [13].\nEpithelioid sarcoma is the most crucial differential diagnosis to rule out. Both epithelioid sarcoma and PHE share several clinical characteristics in common, including the tendency to affect young patients, preference for soft tissue in the distal extremities, epithelioid and spindle cell shape, and diffuse keratin expression. Additionally, FLI1 and ERG are positive in some epithelioid sarcoma patients. Epitheloid sarcoma is a more aggressive tumor than PHE with a higher propensity for local metastasis and recurrence [14]. Thus, it is crucial to distinguish between epithelioid sarcoma and PHE due to these differences. In addition to geographic necrosis, epithelioid sarcoma exhibits increased nuclear atypia. It generally lacks reactivity to CD31, FLI1, and INI-1. The absence or mild immunoreactivity for ERG can be beneficial, while epithelioid sarcomas are commonly ERG+ when antibodies against the N-terminus are used [15]. In addition, a study showed that 51/97 cases (52.6 %) of epithelioid sarcoma positive for CD34; while CD34 is consistently negative in PHE [8].\nIn some PHE cases, focal nuclear atypia and enhanced mitotic activity may prompt the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma. Most epithelioid angiosarcoma cases, unlike PHE, have vascular channels or cysts lined by malignant endothelial cells. Furthermore, as CD34 is often positive in angiosarcoma and negative in PHE, it will help in resolving that differential diagnosis.\nSurgery, including wide excision, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are used as treatment options. Distant metastasis only occurred in 3 patients (5 %) and was discovered 4, 8.5, and 16 years after the initial diagnosis. A second patient's concomitant squamous cell carcinoma caused their death [16]. Twenty-six patients (43 %) had new lesions or signs of a local recurrence in the same area as the original tumor; these recurrences were primarily noticed in the first year following diagnosis. Interesting though, a lot of the lesions remained unchanged throughout time [2], [7]. In this report, the patient is doing well, and no recurrence was observed six months after the resection.\n4. Conclusion\nPHE is a rare vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that has been documented in several body sites. It exhibits a clinical presentation resembling epithelioid sarcoma. It can be difficult to diagnose this tumor without morphologic evidence of a vascular pattern, thus an immunohistochemistry panel is needed. The clinical course of PHE appears to be variable, with frequent local recurrence but a low rate of distant metastases. Prolonged intervals of follow-up are advised due to the real, although slight, potential of distant metastasis developing several years after the initial diagnosis.\nEthical approval\nNo ethical approval.\nConsent\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

Over 50% of patients present with metastatic disease, requiring systemic therapy, although no systemic therapies are specifically approved for EHE. Retrospective evidence supports the activity of mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus), although available only off-label. EHE patients and advocates are therefore working to support approval of effective treatments by collecting data on patient perspectives and experiences.\nMaterials and methods\nIn February 2023, the EHE Rare Cancer Charity (UK) and The EHE Foundation (US), with other advocates, conducted a survey of perspectives and experiences of EHE patients regarding the use and accessibility of sirolimus. The survey consisted of 20 questions designed for individuals undergoing treatment, those who had been treated, or had never been treated with the drug. Widely promoted within the patient community, the online survey categorized patients into three cohorts for the analysis: liver transplant patients, non-transplant patients who had ever taken sirolimus and sirolimus-naïve non-transplant patients.\nResults\nThe survey evaluated data from 129 patient responses from 21 countries, mostly from USA, UK, Australia, and Canada (70%). The liver transplant, sirolimus and non-sirolimus cohorts were 16%, 25% and 59%, respectively. In the sirolimus group 66% reported treatment durations exceeding one year, with 16% exceeding five years, indicating the drug’s efficacy. In the non-sirolimus group, the drug was not available for 42% and for 11% sirolimus was available but not selected for treatment because of its off-label status. Overall, 87% of all patients across all cohorts expressed the importance of the drug’s availability as hugely or very important.\nConclusion\nThe survey responses highlight the activity of sirolimus for EHE and the importance of securing a label extension for the drug delivering equitable access to this treatment for patients.\nKeywords: sarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, sirolimus, patient advocates, drug repurposing, patient survey, EHE\nBackground\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is an ultra-rare vascular sarcoma, with an incidence of 0.038/100,000/year and a prevalence of <1/1,000,000, originating from the endothelium of blood vessels. It can arise anywhere in the body including soft tissue, bones, visceral organs, muscles, and skin (1–5). It is reported that more than half of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, most commonly involving liver, lung, pleura, and bones. EHE can occur at any age but is most prevalent between 30 and 50 years and is marginally more prevalent in women (5).\nEHE is characterized predominantly by two chromosomal translocations leading in about 90% of cases to the WW Domain Containing Transcription Regulator 1 (WWTR1) - also called transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) – and Calmodulin Binding Transcription Activator 1 (CAMTA1) fusion gene, and approximately 10% to the Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and Transcription Factor Binding To IGHM Enhancer 3 (TFE3) fusion gene (1, 5–8).\nThe clinical presentation can vary widely from indolent, asymptomatic disease to aggressive, symptomatic disease with widespread systemic involvement. The aggressive form acts as a high-grade sarcoma often with symptoms (pain, loss of weight, fatigue, and fever) and involves the lung or abdominal serosal surfaces (3, 9). There is currently no way to predict when indolent disease may become more aggressive, making any form of accurate prognosis impossible. As a result, the five-year survival expectancy ranges between 20% - 70% (10, 11).\nNo active medical treatments are specifically approved for EHE, while soft tissue sarcoma treatments are typically reported to be inactive (12). For localized disease, surgery or other locoregional treatments are the standard approach, including liver transplantation that is usually followed by immunosuppressive therapy to avoid organ rejection, often including mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus. For asymptomatic patients with metastatic disease, active surveillance is commonly used as a first approach (3). For patients with disease progression and/or worsening of symptoms, systemic treatment is indicated. Local procedures are also sometimes an option to reduce disease burden/symptoms.\nSystemic treatments are highly variable and rely largely on historical case reports and clinician experience. Patients are treated with soft tissue sarcoma treatment schedules, while other treatments shown to be active through clinical use are also used in clinical studies or ‘off label’ (12–21), but only if off-label use is feasible (based on insurance, health system or country-level medical regulations).\nIn 2020, clinical experts and patient advocates convened under the umbrella of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) to establish a consensus position on the management of EHE (3). The experts recognized that mTOR inhibitors represent the best treatment option in this setting (3), including sirolimus. mTOR inhibitors are not formally approved for treatment of sarcomas. However, retrospective data indicate sirolimus has antitumor activity in advanced and moderately progressive disease (16–21), with a growing body of real-world data supporting its use. However, with little interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing this class of compounds in EHE, access to sirolimus represents a major challenge as some patients are unable to receive the treatment off-label, resulting in inequalities in disease management and patient care. It is for this reason that repurposing of sirolimus for the treatment of EHE represents a solution to an unmet medical need.\nDrug repurposing is a development strategy that seeks to establish new medical indications for existing licensed medications rather than from the de novo development of new molecules (22). Repurposing is particularly important for ultra-rare diseases where the low incidence, a lack of historical studies, limited research or commercial interest means it is impossible to generate data sets to comply with established regulatory procedures that are the standard for more common diseases. In October 2021, following the European Commission’s Expert Group on Safe and Timely Access to Medicines for Patients (STAMP) program, and recognizing these challenges, the EMA launched a pilot program to support the repurposing of medicines. The repurposing of sirolimus for progressive EHE was one of the projects selected for inclusion in the pilot, which has led to a continuing dialogue between regulators, clinicians, researchers, not-for-profit organizations, and patient advocates.\nTo complement dialogue with regulators and increase the available evidence, EHE patient advocates conducted a survey within the global EHE community to gain patients’ perspectives on sirolimus. This undertaking was primarily driven by The EHE Foundation (EHEF), from the USA, and the UK-based the EHE Rare Cancer Charity UK (EHERCC). The EHEF is a US-based non-profit 501c3 organization, founded in 2015, dedicated to pursuing effective treatments for EHE and supporting patients and their families. The Foundation serves the global EHE community with its mission to find treatments and a cure, by advancing research and driving collaboration between patients, researchers, and clinicians. The EHERCC was established in 2015 by the EHE patient community that had come together under the EHE Patient Support Facebook group. The charity has three core objectives: (i) patient support and advocacy; (ii) fundraising; and (iii) promoting and funding a dynamic research programme. EHERCC is an independent entity but works in close collaboration with other EHE foundations and patients’ groups established by the EHE patient community from 2015. While based in the UK, EHERCC is also engaged with and establishing, a pan-European patient network.\nNotably, at the time of survey development, a formal EHE patient registry was not available. Results of the survey and conclusions that can be drawn are the subject of this manuscript.\nMaterials and methods\nSurvey development\nThe survey developers, as representatives of the patient community, conducted a thorough review of patients’ comments, questions, and experiences about the use of sirolimus shared in a private online Facebook community of ~2500 EHE members and/or carers to identify themes for development of a survey.\nThe survey was constructed using the online SurveyMonkey® platform. Questions were developed by EHE patient advocates. The question set is included in the Supplementary Information. An explanatory introduction of the survey was included to inform the targeted community of the rationale for the survey, as well as disclose the intended use of the data. Participation in the survey was voluntary, and participants were informed that their responses would be used anonymously for the purpose of bringing patients’ collective experiences to physicians and regulators. A privacy statement was published for participants. Participants were able to give their contact information and permission to be re-contacted by the survey administrators. Proceeding to answer the questions in the survey was interpreted as consent. As the inclusion of pediatric patients or patients in poor health might be expected, prospective participants who may be care givers for patients were instructed on how to answer questions about the patient. The survey was provided in English-language only.\nSurvey design\nThe survey consisted of 20 questions and sought to gain perspectives from all EHE patients on sirolimus, regardless of whether they had used the drug or not. The survey design did not define any exclusion criteria. Participants were asked to include their country of origin, year of birth and disease presentation. All participants had to enter the year of EHE diagnosis. Questions were developed with branching logic established based upon patients’ responses to key questions such as ‘having had an organ transplant’ (to identify patients taking sirolimus to avoid organ rejection following liver transplantation) or ‘having ever taken or currently taking sirolimus’. Responses to these initial questions ensured that participants would be asked questions relevant to their disease and treatment experiences. Evaluable responses were defined by inclusion of country, year of diagnosis, disease sites, liver transplant status, and sirolimus status (taking/have taken or never taken). The survey branching logic is shown in Figure 1 of the Supplementary Information.\n\nAnalysis dataset construction workflow.\nSurvey distribution and administration\nThe survey was introduced to the global EHE community via email and social media channels. The EHEF and EHERCC maintain email subscriber lists for communication with their constituents; 698 patients and caregivers were emailed with appropriate follow-up emails over a 14-day period. Additionally, the survey was publicized widely in the private Facebook group. Advocacy groups in Australia, Canada, and Italy similarly shared in their regions. The survey did not permit more than one response from the same device to reduce the risk of participants responding more than once.\nData were collected and stored by EHEF and EHERCC, with results presented in de-identified, aggregate form to the EHE community and regulators. The raw data were downloaded as an Excel formatted table, with one row of data per participant. An automated process was developed to take the raw data and cleanse and standardize it, with a clear audit trail of changes generated by this process.\nStatistical methods\nWe performed a descriptive analysis based on the results of the survey. Microsoft Excel 365 64-bit (version 2310) was used for all statistical analysis and the generation of descriptive statistics. Age was calculated as the year of birth subtracted from 2023, with missing values excluded. Years of disease was calculated as the year of diagnosis subtracted from 2023, with missing values excluded. All charts and tables were generated using Microsoft Excel.\nFor analysis, participants were classified as belonging to one of three groups: the sirolimus group (Group S), this includes all non-liver transplant patients taking or having taken sirolimus for EHE; and the non-sirolimus group (Group NS), this includes all non-liver transplant patients not taking or have never taken sirolimus; and the liver transplant group (Group LT), this includes all liver transplant patients, irrespective of current or past treatment with sirolimus. Liver transplant patients were treated as a separate cohort as they may be taking sirolimus, other mTOR inhibitors or other immune suppresants for prophylaxis against organ transplant rejection. The effect of sirolimus in this patient population would be difficult to interpret.\nResults\nDescription of patient groups\nFrom 11/02/23 to 26/02/23, a total of 130 responses from individual EHE patients or carers from 21 countries worldwide were recorded. 129/130 (99%) were considered adequate for the present analysis (1/130 contained only two completed fields and was excluded for data insufficiency). 115/129 (89%) of the evaluable surveys did not require data correction, while 11/129 (9%) included fields that could be automatically corrected (i.e., date formats standardized), 3/129 (2%) required follow up via email and 2/129 (1%) required text translation. The data flow for the data cleansing and standardization process is shown in Figure 1.\nDescription of participants\nOf 129 participants, 32/129 (25%) were included in Group S, 76/129 (59%) in Group NS, and 21/129 (16%) in Group LT, Table 1. The median age (years) of all participants was 47.6 (range 14-81); in Group S, 39.4 (range 14-74), Group NS 51.1 (range 15-81) and Group LT 47.4 (range 32-71). Overall, participants had a median 6.6 years since EHE diagnosis (range 1-26), 7.4 (range 1-26) for Group S, 6.1 (range 1-23) for Group NS, and 9.4 (range 2-21) for Group LT.\nDemographic and disease presentation information by patient cohort.\n\nFigure 2 shows the distribution by (decadal) age of participants, note that 2/129 participants did not include year of birth. The distribution shows no indications of age-related bias.\n\nDistribution by age of participants.\nThe highest number of responses were from United States (n=50/129, 39%), followed by United Kingdom (n=19/129, 15%), Canada (n=12/129, 9%), Italy (n=9/129, 9%), and Australia (n=9/129, 7%). Number of responses by country is shown in Supplementary Table 1.\nDisease presentation\nReported disease presentation is shown in Table 1, both overall and by patient group.\nPatients’ experiences and reported responses in Group S\nGroup S contained 32/129 (25%) participants. Figure 3A shows the reasons for sirolimus treatment initiation. The most common reason was ‘progressive disease’ (n=18/32, 56%); 6/32 (19%) responded ‘my doctor recommended’, 6/32 (19%) responded ‘had significant EHE-related symptoms’. Six/32 (19%) patients included more than one reason as per the survey structure.\n\nPatient experiences of the Group S (sirolimus) cohort. (A): Reasons for initiating sirolimus treatment. (B): Duration, in years, of sirolimus treatment. (C): Patient perspective on the effect of sirolimus treatment. (D): Reasons for cessation of sirolimus treatment.\nAt the time the survey was undertaken 20/32 (63%) patients were still on treatment with sirolimus, while 12/32 (37%) had discontinued therapy. Reasons for discontinuation, shown in Figure 3D, were side effects (3/12, 25%); disease progression (3/12, 25%); clinician decision (2/12, 17%), other (2/12, 16%). Other reasons cited by patients included stopping sirolimus to take part in a clinical trial (1/12, 8%) and lack of symptomatic relief (1/12, 8%). Of the 11 patients who selected a reason for discontinuation, 5/12 (42%) could be directly attributed to the drug not working. Note that 2/12 (17%) patients reported multiple reasons for stopping sirolimus.\nThe duration of sirolimus treatment is shown in Figure 3B. Duration of treatment was available for 31/32 (97%) patients and ranged from ‘less than 6 months’ to ‘more than 5 years. Participants reporting duration of treatment as ‘less than 6 months’ (n=8/32, 25%) or ‘6-12 months’ (n=2/32, 6%) while durations of more than 1 year were (n=21/32, 66%). Of note, 5/32 (16%) participants reported duration of treatment for more than 5 years and 16/32 (50%) participants reported duration of 1-5 years treatment.\nWhen asked what effect treatment with sirolimus was having/had had, 11/32 (34%) reported disease stabilization; 9/32 (28%) tumors shrank, or tumors stopped growing, 3/32 (9%) mixed treatment effect on tumors (some tumor lesions shrank, some did not shrink or some stopped growing and remained stable, while some grew), 2/32 (6%) reported not having a good treatment effect on tumors or EHE-related symptoms indicating disease progression, 4/32 (13%) were unsure if sirolimus had helped their EHE, as shown in Figure 3C.\nPatients’ self-reported outcomes for Group S are shown in Figure 4D. If we combine the stable and good treatment effect outcomes as patient perception of clinical benefit, 20/32 (63%) of the group regarded the treatment as of benefit, as shown in Figure 4D. Only 2/32 (6%) patients perceived that the treatment had no clear benefit, and 7/32 (22%) reported mixed outcomes.\n\nPatient experiences and perspectives in Group NS (non-sirolimus) and Group S (sirolimus) cohorts. (A): Availability of sirolimus as a treatment option. (B): Results of discussion of sirolimus with doctors. (C): Importance of availability of sirolimus for all patient cohorts. (D): Group S patient perception of the clinical effect of sirolimus.\nPatients’ experiences and perspectives in Group NS\nGroup NS included 76/129 (59%) participants.\nAvailability of sirolimus to patients\nParticipants in the Group NS were asked ‘Was sirolimus one of the treatment options available, but was not selected for clinical reasons?’ The results are shown in Figure 4A. 40/76 (53%) replied yes or no, the rest either having stable disease (28/76), not remembering (3/76), or not answering (5/76). For 32/76 (42%) participants sirolimus was not available, and for 8/76 (11%) sirolimus was available but not selected for treatment. A related question asked whether sirolimus was available but was not selected because it was not approved for EHE, i.e., it would have to be used off-label. Of the 8 patients who answered that it was available but not selected in Figure 4A, all (100%) responded that it was due to being off-label.\nDiscussion of sirolimus with doctors\nPatients in the NS group were asked if sirolimus was ever discussed or mentioned as a treatment option by their doctor. Results are shown in Figure 4B. Participants were given the option to select more than one response.\nImportance of access and availability of sirolimus to all participants\nParticipants were asked to select how important it is to have sirolimus available to all EHE patients. Scoring ranged from ‘hugely important’ to ‘not very important’, as shown in Figure 4C. The question conceivably covers all the uses of sirolimus – including for progressive disease and for prophylaxis against organ transplant rejection, but the high importance reported by patients is consistently high across all groups. 98/129 (76%) participants from all three participant groups placed availability of sirolimus to all patients as ‘hugely important’.\nDiscussion\nThis survey, conducted by EHE patient advocates within the global EHE patient community to gain patients’ perspectives on sirolimus for EHE, involved 129 participants from 21 countries, and successfully achieved its primary objective of gaining deeper insights into the treatment experiences and perspectives of patients related to this systemic therapy. Considering the patient perception of clinical benefit resulting in 20/32 (63%) of participants reporting clinical benefit, the survey findings further endorse the consensus position of the ESMO community of sarcoma experts, suggesting that the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus should be regarded as a front-line treatment for progressive EHE.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset produced within the patient community, yielding important knowledge from a real-world setting of such a rare disease. This effort provides valuable information from a patient cohort, contributing significantly to our understanding of the management of the disease and patient experiences.\nThe outreach approaches to ask EHE patients to participate in the survey via relevant social media channels, email, and newsletters, ensured that the risk of bias was reduced by not limiting by region or disease-specific sub-groups. The participation of patients from 21 countries worldwide further ensured the representative nature of the participant cohort and the reduction of the risk of skewing of results due to a single national jurisdiction or health system. The inclusion of a majority of participants (64%) having never taken sirolimus for any reason also demonstrates that there was no unintentional bias with, for example, just sirolimus patients participating.\nThe objective of demonstrating that the survey patient cohort was representative of EHE in terms of the age distribution of the patients was also met with a good comparison of characteristics as described in the literature for EHE (10). Disease presentation reported by participants aligns closely with the most reported presentations of EHE in literature, which include liver, lung, and bones (10). Participants who have taken or are still taking sirolimus reported very similar EHE presentation as those who have not taken sirolimus.\nTo keep the survey appropriately simple for participants, we included two measures of potential efficacy that could be answered by patients with limited medical or scientific knowledge. The first was the duration that they had been on the drug, and the second was a prescribed menu of effects the drug had had on their EHE.\nDuration on the drug is seen as a good indicator as clinicians only start to prescribe systemic treatments when they have verified disease progression, through growing tumor burden on radiological imaging and/or increasing symptoms. The effect of the systemic drug prescribed is then monitored over a period of typically 3 to 6 months, with dosage increases often tried if disease progression continues. In the event of the drug failing to have a positive impact, patients will be moved to another treatment. Patients who were still on the drug were therefore requested to confirm how long they had been taking sirolimus. Any duration of more than 1 year is viewed as positive, and multi-year durations are seen as exceptional when compared against reported outcomes of other drugs within the EHE patient community. In our sample of patients taking sirolimus as a systemic treatment for EHE, 66% of patients have been taking sirolimus for more than 12 months, and 29% had been taking it for more than 2 years. Five patients, 16%, had been on sirolimus for more than five years.\nWe wanted to understand the main reason for the cessation of treatment. A simple menu of reasons for stopping treatment was provided. A category of ‘other’ with the ability to provide additional reasons in open text was included to allow for reasons not included in the prescribed answers. Of the 32 participants in the sirolimus group, 12 (38%) had ceased treatment with the drug. The clearest lack of efficacy signal is progressive disease, which was the reason listed by 3 participants, representing 9% of the sirolimus group. Some reasons for cessation appear to be unrelated to the drug efficacy, for example participating in a clinical trial, using a treatment protocol limited to two years of sirolimus, or misdiagnosis of disease progression. Three patients discontinued due to side effects, and one patient commented that the drug did not provide symptomatic relief.\nOverall, the rate of discontinuation does not appear to be entirely driven by lack of efficacy, even though this is difficult to confirm from the survey.\nThe importance of having sirolimus available for EHE patients is underscored by the data in Figure 4C. The overwhelming response to this question is either ‘hugely important’ (76%) or ‘very important’ (11%). It is notable that the answers do not differ by patient group. The data from Figure 4A show that for some patients the question is pressing. For 32 (42%) patients the drug is not available because it would have to be used off-label, and for 8 (11%) it is available but has not been prescribed by treating physicians due to the drug not being approved for EHE in the specific country. Figure 4B illustrates the absence of dialogue about sirolimus as a treatment option, reiterating the importance of education and advocacy to ensure patients and their clinicians are well-informed about efficacious treatment options, including off-label therapies.\nOverall, while providing a valuable data set in such a rare disease, we acknowledge that this survey has limitations. These include the lack of detailed treatment history, limited description of disease presentation, symptoms assessments, insurance or health care payment requirements, and information about where participants receive care. We recognize that an opportunity was missed in not including biological gender in the survey that would have provided a further valid parameter for demonstrating that the participant cohort was representative of the disease.\nWe also recognize that the survey does not collate more detailed knowledge of a participant’s disease, nor the specific developments that led to the decision to start systemic treatment. There is also no record of whether a participant was prescribed sirolimus as the first-line treatment for their progressive EHE, or whether other drugs had been prescribed and failed prior to taking sirolimus. This additional information would provide a more detailed description of each patient’s situation but was felt to run the risk of overwhelming patients resulting in their non-participation. For this reason, the relatively simple survey described above was adopted.\nHowever, we believe that these data, that provide patients’ perspectives, add to what is already available in the literature and are aligned with results available from retrospective studies of sirolimus in EHE. They can further inform researchers, clinicians, and regulators and should be included in future discussion on sirolimus in this tumor type and in future surveys and PROs assessment.\nSince this survey, the EHE Global Patient Registry (https://fightehe.org/registry/), a natural history study of EHE, has been ethically approved and is enrolling EHE patients from all countries to gather additional data about treatment with sirolimus, and all other disease management therapies and therapeutic strategies. Further analysis and publications of these invaluable data are anticipated in the future.\nConclusions\nAn EHE diagnosis presents an unpredictable journey, for doctors and patients, resulting in uncertainty in both prognosis and future treatments, and high levels of patient anxiety, while those who are living with advanced or progressive disease face significant unmet medical needs. For such patients, it is reasonable to expect that they and their clinicians want all options available that can keep the disease stable by deterring or halting growth of tumors and symptoms.\nFaced with a devastating EHE diagnosis, patients need hope beyond a natural desire to survive. For patients, the hope of an effective treatment option has surfaced with growing data from the clinical and patient community regarding the positive outcomes of treatment with sirolimus. Data collected in this survey demonstrates further that people living with EHE who have taken or are currently taking sirolimus are experiencing benefit. These results also justify mTOR inhibitors being selected by the ESMO community of experts to be the front-line systemic treatment for the disease, and why the drug is now being prescribed off-label in many major jurisdictions. Patients are also aware that sirolimus has been approved by multiple regulatory bodies for the treatment of other indications, including prophylaxis against organ transplant rejection and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These approvals give assurance to patients that the drug is safe for consumption, with controlled dosing as indicated.\nHowever, while data supports sirolimus as an efficacious systemic treatment for EHE, there are still patients who cannot access the drug while it is only available off-label. This inequitable access to an effective drug is unacceptable, and it is to remedy this situation that EHE patient advocates, with clinicians and researchers, are working with regulators to secure the necessary approvals so that patients may have access to and can benefit from sirolimus regardless of their location. Indeed, patients have a right to expect regulators to recognize the challenges faced by ultra-rare cancers and accept evidence appropriate to the rarity of the disease and expeditiously approve drugs that are proven to have safe, positive effects on the patients’ disease, quality of life, and life expectancy.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics statement\nEthical approval was not required for the studies involving humans because the data was from a patient survey, with details of how the data was to be used included in the survey.

It was originally recognized as a variant of epitheloid sarcoma, however it is now concluded as a distinctive, rarely metastasizing endothelial neoplasm. We present a case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the lower limb in a 49-year-old female who has a long course of disease and suffered from twice local recurrences and lymph node affection of the tumor. The mass was subcutaneous and the margins were ill-defined. Morphologically, the tumor cells show diversity, composed of large spindle cells and round cells, both with abundant eocinophilic cytoplasm, mimicking rhybdomyoplasts and epitheloid cells respectively. The tumor cells show diffuse strong expression of Factor VIII, Fli-1, INI-1, vimentin, MDM2, and CDK4, local expression of CD31, AE1/AE3, EMA and P63, and no expression of CD34, S-100, actin-sm, desmin, MyoD1, and HMB45. Based on these information, this case is diagnosed as pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma after ruling out the main differential diagnosises including epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. From this case we suggest that pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma may be confused with a variety of soft tissue neoplasm histologically. The clinical feature of the case of a long course of disease with twice local recurrences and final lymph node involvement 10 years after excision of the primary tumor indicates a relative indolent behavior of this tumor.\nBackground\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, also known as epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, occurs more frequently in young adult males and usually arises in the extremities, especially on the lower limb, and often involves multiple tissue planes [1–5]. It histologically mimics a myoid tumor or epithelioid carcinoma due to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and the cell shape [1–5]. It is now characterized as a distinctive, rarely metastasizing endothelial neoplasm [1]. The tumor is composed of large round or spindle cells, or commonly both parts, arranged in sheets or fascicles. The cells rarely show notable pleomorphism or nuclear atypia [1–3]. Clinically, more than half of the patients experience local recurrence, and lymph node and distant metastasis in a few cases has also been reported [1–9]. In the case we present here, the patient experienced a long course of disease and twice recurrences and lymph node involvement of the tumor after excision of the primary tumor 10 years ago. Morphologically, the tumor is composed of both areas of round and spindle cells with abundant eocinophilic cytoplasm, which may lead to confusion with a variety of other soft tissue neoplasm such as epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. The immunophenotype of expression of INI-1, AE1/AE3, and endothelial markers such as Factor VIII, Fli-1 and CD31, and negative staining of desmin, MyoD1, and S-100 supports the diagnosis of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in this case.\nCase presentation\nClinical history\nA 49-year-old female referred to our hospital for recurrence of soft tissue tumor with multiple nodules in her left lower limb. MRI shows that the nodules were subcutaneous at the left calf below the knee and integrated to a mass about 6 cm × 5 cm. The mass has been growing up gradually for 2 years without treatment. Before that, the patient had a primary tumor about 1 cm × 1 cm in the same location about 10 years ago. The patient experienced once recurrence with a new mass at the same location around the incision 2 years after local excision of the primary one. This new mass grew up to about 5 cm × 3 cm in 3 years and then the patient received a second surgery. And now it is the second recurrence of the tumor and the third time for her to receive surgery. MRI also detected a subcutaneous mass about 3.2 cm × 3.4 cm at her left thigh near the inguinal area this time. Blood test of the patient shows no abnomity. The urinary test shows slight high levels of red blood cells (5.11/HPF), white blood cells (3.09/HPF), epithelial cells (2.02/HPF) and urea (7.73 mmol/L).\nMaterials and methods\nThe resected specimens of the tumor were fixed with 10 % neutralbuffered formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks. Tissue blocks were cut into 4 μm-thick sections and the sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated stepwise in descending ethanol series. Then the sections were boiled in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) within an autoclave. Endogenous peroxidase activity and non-specific binding were blocked with 3 % H2O2 and non-immune sera, respectively. The sections were then incubated with the following primary antibodies: actin-sm (1:50, DAKO), AE1/AE3 (1:50, DAKO), CD31 (1:100, DAKO), CD34 (1:100, DAKO), cytokeratin 18 (CK18, 1:200, DAKO), cytokeratin 19 (CK19, 1:200, DAKO), CDK4 (1:50, Abcam), desmin (1:50, DAKO), EMA (1:100, DAKO), Fli-1 (1:100, Abcam), Factor VIII (1:100, Abcam), HMB45 (1:50, Abcam), INI-1 (1:100, Santa Cruz), Ki67 (1:200, DAKO), Melan-A (1:50, DAKO), myoD1 (1:50, DAKO), MDM2 (1:50, Abcam), P63 (1:100, DAKO), S-100 (1:50, DAKO), and vimentin (1:200, DAKO) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the catalyzed signal amplification system (Maixin Biotechnology, Fuzhou, Fujian, China) was used for staining of these proteins according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The antibodies were detected by a standard avidin-biotin complex method with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Maixin) and an avidin-biotin complex (Maixin), and developed with diaminobenzidine. Counterstaining was done lightly with hematoxylin, and the sections were dehydrated in alcohol before mounting. This study was prospectively performed and approved by the institutional Ethics Committees of China Medical University and conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nResults\nGross features\nThe resected samples inspected include nodules from the left calf and thigh of the patient. The masses are subcutaneous with multiple nodules integrated with each other and the margins are ill-defined. The mass from the calf is about 5.5 cm × 4.2 cm × 2.5 cm, and the one from the thigh is about 3.0 cm × 3.0 cm × 2.5 cm. The cut surface of the masses is firm, and grey and yellowish white. MRI shows multiple subcutaneous nodules at the left calf below the knee integrating to a mass about 6 cm × 5 cm. The biggest one was about 1.4 cm × 0.9 cm (Fig. 1a, T1-weighted image shows low signal intensity; 1B, T2-weighted image (STIR) shows high signal intensity). MRI also detected a subcutaneous mass about 3.2 cm × 3.4 cm at the left thigh near the inguinal area (Fig. 1c, T1-weighted image shows low signal intensity; 1D, T2-weighted image (STIR) shows high signal intensity).\n\nThe imaging (MRI) of the tumor. MRI shows multiple subcutaneous nodules at the left calf below the knee integrating to a mass about 6 cm × 5 cm. The biggest one was about 1.4 cm × 0.9 cm. (a, T1-weighted image shows low signal intensity, ; b, T2-weighted image (STIR) shows high signal intensity, ). MRI also detected a subcutaneous mass about 3.2 cm × 3.4 cm at the left thigh near the inguinal area (c, T1-weighted image shows low signal intensity, ; d, T2-weighted image (STIR) shows high signal intensity, )\nMicroscopic features\nThe tumor cells are diffusely distributed between the subcutaneous tissues with an invasive growth pattern and ill-defined (Fig. 1a). Most of the tumor tissues are cellular, and a few areas of the tumor have myxoid stroma and scattered tumor cells (Fig. 1b, c, d). The tumor cells are round or spindle in different areas, both with abundant eocinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in sheets, fascicles or irregularly (Fig. 1b, c, d, e, f). The tumor cells are large and plump, but show no apparent pleomorphism. The nuclei of the cells are also plump with small nucleoli without notable atypia and the mitotic activity is scarce (Fig. 1e, f). The microscopic features of the primary tumor were the same as the recurrent tumor (Fig. 1g, h). The microscopic feature of the mass from the left thigh indicates lymph node metastasis of the tumor (Fig. 2).\n\nMorphological features of the tumor. Ill-defined tumor cells are diffusely distributed between the subcutaneous tissues (a,×100). Most of the tumor tissues are cellular with large plump spindle cells (b,×200) or round cells (c,×200). Some areas of the tumor have myxoid stroma and scattered small round tumor cells (d,×200). The tumor cells are spindle (e,×100) or round (f,×400) in different areas, both with abundant eocinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor cells are large and plump, showing no apparent pleomorphism. The nuclei of the tumor cells have small nucleoli without notable atypia and the mitotic activity is scarce (e, f,×400). The microscopic features of the primary tumor were the same as the recurrent tumor (g, ×100; h,×400)\nImmunophenotype\nImmunohistochemical examination indicates that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for Factor VIII, Fli-1, CDK4, INI-1, MDM2, vimentin, focally positive for AE1/AE3, CD31 and negative for actin-sm, CD34, desmin, myoD1 and S-100 (Fig. 3). Ki67 index was about 5 % (Fig. 3). In addition, EMA and P63 expression was focal, CK18, CK19, HMB45 and melan-A were negative in the tumor cells. The primary tumor also shows a typical Fli-1 and INI-1 positive immunostaining phenotype (Fig. 5).\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of the tumor. Fli-1 in tumor cells was diffusely positive and the staining was strong as well as in the endothelial cells. CD31 was focally positive. INI-1 expression was retained. AE1/AE3 staining was focal and not very strong. CD34 in tumor cells was very weak or absent compared to endothelial cells. Vimentin was strongly and diffusely positive. Desmin, S-100 and myoD1 were negative. MDM2 and CDK4 were strongly and diffusely positive. Ki67 index was about 5 %\n\nLymph node metastasis of the tumor in the thigh far from the primary lesion of the recurrenct tumor and the original tumor. The large round epithelioid tumor cells are similar in shape to those in the tumor from the lower limb of the patient (a × 100; b × 200)\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of the primary tumor. It also shows a typical immunostaining phenotype of positive Fli-1 and INI-1 expression as the recurrent tumor\nDiscussion\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, also named as epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, which morphologically mimics a myoid tumor or epithelioid carcinoma, is now concluded as a distinctive, rarely metastasizing endothelial neoplasm [1–5]. This tumor occurs more frequently in young adult males and usually arises in the extremities [1–5]. In the case we presented here, the patient was a 49-year-old female who had a long course of disease about 10 years with this tumor in her lower limb.\nThe tumor is composed of large spindle cells, arranged in sheets or fascicles. Tumor cells with epithelioid cytomorphology are also often present [1–5]. In this case, the tumor is subcutaneous and both areas with spindle cells and round epithelioid cells exist. The cells are large and have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, mimicking a myoid tumor or epithelioid carcinoma cells. The tumor cells are plump, but show no apparent pleomorphism. The nuclei of the cells have small nucleoli without notable atypia and the mitotic activity is scarce. Based on these information, the main differential diagnosises should include epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. Epithelioid sarcoma is a mesenchymal neoplasm exhibiting epithelioid cytomorphology, the classic subtype of which often occurs in the extremity [1]. Spindle tumor cells can also present in this tumor. The cell pleomorphism and nuclear atypia are not notable usually in this tumor either. However classic epithelioid sarcoma usually consists of cellular node with central degeneration which is not seen in this case though it cannot be ruled out only based on this feature. The tumor cells in this case exhibit abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm mimicking myoid tumor. Thus rhabdomyosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma should also be considered. Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm exhibiting pure smooth-muscle differentiation [1]. The tumor consists mainly of spindle sells arranged in fascicles. However epithelioid cytomorphology can also exist, though relatively rare. The nuclear pleomorphism is generally notable in leiomyosarcoma which was not seen in this case. There are several subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma, among which spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma is the most important to be differentiated for this case. This subtype has spindle cell morphology with eosinophilic cytoplasm and shows a fascicular or plaxiform growth pattern [1]. Epithelioid cells are rare and nuclear atypia is common in this subtype, which is different from this case. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is a malignant tumor arising from peripheral nerves, which mostly arises in the extremities [1]. Typical type of this tumor consists of spindle cells showing a fascicular growth pattern. However there is also an epithelioid subtype of this tumor composed of epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, which should also be considered for this case. The neoplasmic cells of this type are cohesive together or scattered and embedded in the extracellular myxoid matrix. The similar areas also exist in this case. However prominent nucleoli are often seen in the tumor cells of this type but not in this case. Moreover areas with spindle cells are also main parts of the tumor in this case which is not usual in the epithelioid subtype of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. However, a variety of complicated and similar histological features can present in all these tumors and the microscopic features could not be the only basis for differentiation for these tumors.\nIn the current case, immunohistochemical examination shows that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for endothelia cell markers Factor VIII and Fli-1 and focally positive for CD31. However these markers are not absolutely specific for endothelial cells. The other mesenchymal tumors mentioned above should be ruled out. INI-1 expression has been found to be lost in some tumors including epithelioid sarcoma [1]. In this case INI-1 expression was retained. The myoid tumor markers such as actin-sm and desmin were negative in this case. S-100, a marker usually positive in tumors arising from nervous system including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, was also negative in this case. However even in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, S-100 expression is not always detected [1]. We need to differentiate theses tumors more carefully based on more information but not only on one marker like S-100. vimentin was diffusely positive in the tumor cells, which supports but cannot fully prove the tumor as a mesenchymal neoplasm. As for keratins, AE1/AE3 was focally but not diffusely positive in this case. AE1/AE3 was usually positive in cases of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma reported so far [1–5, 10–14]. Some documents mentioned that the immunostaining pattern is diffuse. However the documents are limited and more cases are still in need to be studied to verify the immunostaining pattern of this marker. CD34 expression is usually negative in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, however a report indicates that it was positive in some cases [3]. In a word, the immunophenotype of this tumor is still to be studied and characterized. From these information it may be more reasonable to considere this case as an endothelial neoplasm but not myoid tumor, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, or epithelioid sarcoma. Ki67 index in this case was about 5 % and not very high. MDM2 and CDK4 overexpression are not usually seen in benign tumors but quite common in intermediate or malignant mesenchymal tumors [15, 16] and was diffusely positive in this case. These three markers are helpful to understand the nature of the tumor and support the consideration of it as a tumor with a certain extent of malignant potentials.\nHowever, the histological feature and immuostaining findings are not enough for fully understanding and characterizing the tumor of this case as usual. The clinical feature is important for the diagnosis and should be carefully studied as always. The patient of this case had experienced a long course of disease with the tumor about 10 years which indicates the tumor is relative indolent. Approximately 60 % of patients with pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma experience local recurrence of the tumor [1]. In this case the patient experienced twice local recurrences at the same location after local excisions. After 10 years the tumor has developed a regional subcutaneous lymph node metastasis in her thigh. No distant metastasis in other organs was found in this patient. Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is now concluded as a intermediate, rarely metastasizing endothelial neoplasm. The clinical feature of this patient is also in accordance with that of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma. Cancer can be caused by various factors including inflammation which can promote the formation of premalignant lesions and promote cancer progression. The immune system plays complicated roles in the progression of malignant tumors [17]. In this case, the patient experienced a couple times of recurrence and at last developed lymph node metastasis. However, there wasn’t any clue of inflammation or auto-immune diseases related found in this patient. So far, the pathogenesis and mechanism involved in the progression of this tumor is not uncovered.\nConclusion\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is a rare endothelial neoplasm which often mimics myoid and epithelioid tumors morphologically. A variety of mesenchymal neoplasms with similar architecture and cell morphology should be carefully differentiated from this tumor. For the diagnosis the immunostaining is very important but not decisive and enough. Clinical information including age, gender, tumor location, disease course and recurrence is important for appropriate diagnosis and fully understanding of the tumor and is indispensable. Analysis based on any single factor or incomplete information may easily lead to arbitrary conclusion. However the reports of this tumor are limited. Further studies on more cases are in need for fully understanding and appropriate diagnosis of it.\nConsent\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no.81472599 to Chuifeng Fan, MD).\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nFCF, YLH, and LXY participated in the histopathological evaluation, performed the literature review, acquired photomicrographs and drafted the manuscript.

It is diagnosed using a combination of imaging studies, histopathological examinations, and immunohistochemical staining. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, with the goal of achieving a wide local excision and reducing the risk of recurrence. The role of systemic therapies is not well established because of the rarity of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, uncertainty regarding its response to currently approved medications, and lack of randomized controlled trials. We describe the case of an 18-year-old male patient diagnosed with multifocal pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma of the left lower limb who was treated with everolimus in addition to denosumab, achieving a partial response that was consolidated with resection, radiofrequency ablation, and radiotherapy of multiple local lesions, achieving a long-lasting response. Following subsequent disease progression, the patient responded favorably to pazopanib, with no significant toxicities.\nKeywords: Hemangioendothelioma; Hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid; Neoplasms, vascular tissue; Everolimus; Denosumab; Pazopanib\nINTRODUCTION\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is an ultrarare vascular sarcoma that typically affects young adults.(1–3) Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma most commonly presents as a locally aggressive disease, although its metastatic potential has been previously described.(4,5) Treatment is mostly based on a surgical approach, because the benefits of systemic therapy or radiation are not well defined.(6)\nWe report a case of a patient presenting with multifocal PMH in multiple tissue planes of the left lower extremity treated successfully with surgical excision in addition to everolimus, denosumab, pazopanib, radiofrequency ablation, and radiation therapy.\nCASE REPORT\nIn February 2021, an 18-year-old male patient with no known comorbidities presented with pain in his left leg and knee during walking. He denied any history of trauma, and a physical examination revealed no signs of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left knee revealed focal areas of bone signal alteration in the distal femur and subcutaneous tissue. Initially, these findings were interpreted as nonspecific and likely unrelated to the patient's symptoms. A subsequent MRI performed due to persistent symptoms 2 months later demonstrated a significant increase in the dimensions of most of the focal bone lesions described in the previous study, located in the left femur, left tibia, and left fibula, as well as the appearance of new soft tissue masses in multiple tissue planes. Subsequently, a positron emission tomography (PET-CT) revealed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity in multiple small osteolytic lesions affecting the distal femur, patella, tibia, fibula, talus, and calcaneus, all within the left lower limb. These lesions were predominantly cortical, exhibiting periosteal and endosteal erosion, and were associated with soft tissue lesions in the muscular and subcutaneous planes.\nIn June 2021, excisional biopsies were performed on four samples: nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the left thigh, nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the left leg, left distal fibular lesions, and left calcaneal lesions. All four samples were processed for histopathological analysis (Figure 1) and immunohistochemistry (Table 1) to confirm the diagnosis of PMH.\nFigure 1.

In addition, somatic genetic testing (Foundation Heme) was performed. After two doses of denosumab, the patient developed worsening symptoms and a new palpable soft tissue nodule. A new PET-CT scan showed an increase in the FDG uptake of bone lesions as well as in the number, dimensions, and FDG uptake of focal nodular lesions of the subcutaneous tissue/muscle of the left thigh and leg. At that time, the results of the somatic testing were available and showed no reportable genomic alterations (Table 2).\nTable 2.

Denosumab treatment was continued because of the presence of active bone lesions. In October 2022, a dose reduction to 5mg/day was required because of severe mucositis (grade 2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events - CTCAE) refractory to topical symptomatic interventions. In the first everolimus response assessment, PET-CT revealed a partial response (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. PET-CT showing response to everolimus. PET-CT, positron emission tomography-computed tomography.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nTherefore, everolimus (5mg/day) combined with denosumab (120mg monthly) was continued. In January 2022, a new PET-CT scan was performed, demonstrating a persistent partial response, although some areas exhibited a slight increase in FDG uptake. No evidence of new lesions was observed. The dose of everolimus was then increased, alternating between 5 and 10mg every other day, and treatment for mucositis was intensified. In April 2022, PET-CT showed that the majority of lesions maintained a partial response, although there were signs of increased glycolytic hypermetabolism in a small focal lesion in the soft tissues of the dorsum of the left midfoot, in the focal lesion in the projection of the soleus muscle of the middle or distal third of the left leg, and in most of the osteolytic lesions in the distal femur, tibia, and fibula on the left.\nIn May 2022, multiple soft tissue tumors of the left thigh, knee, leg, ankle, and foot were surgically resected. In addition, curettage was performed, followed by cementation of the left calcaneal lesion. Intraoperatively, the calcaneal tendon was evaluated, and tumor infiltration was suspected. After an onsite biopsy, the surgeon decided not to remove the entire calcaneal tendon. Moreover, radiofrequency ablation (Medtronics Osteocool™) of multiple lesions of the femur, tibia, fibula, ankle bones, and left foot was required. The pathology report confirmed PMH in all the samples. Most of the lesions had free margins. None of the specimens showed areas of necrosis, although there were occasional areas of fibrosis adjacent to the site of injury. A biopsy of the calcaneal tendon lesion confirmed PMH. Figure 2 shows the pathological findings.\nIn July 2022, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a slight increase in a single lesion located in the myotendinous transition of the calcaneus, which was previously untreated. Subsequently, the patient underwent radiotherapy treatment from 08/29/22 to 09/02/22 at a dose of 2500 cGy (divided into five sessions for the left calcaneal lesion and the same dose for the left fibula head). The patient was closely monitored with imaging examinations every 3 months and remained with no systemic treatment and no evidence of disease progression until May 2023.\nPET-CT performed in May 2023 showed progressive disease with the appearance of new uptake in lytic lesions in the left tarsal cuboid and posterior cortex of the left calcaneus and increased uptake in lytic lesions in the left patella, distal femur, and tibia (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. PET-CT showing progressive disease. PET-CT, positrone emission tomography-computed tomography.\n\nOpen in a new tab\nAt that time, owing to multifocal progression, we decided to pursue systemic therapy. Although the patient responded well to everolimus, mucositis significantly impaired his quality of life during therapy. Therefore, pazopanib treatment was initiated at a standard dose of 800mg/day. Immediately after the initiation of treatment, the patient was admitted to the hospital to treat the erysipelas of the left leg. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed soft tissue infection with no evidence of osteomyelitis.\nThe first PET-CT scan after the start of pazopanib in July 2023 showed a reduction in the uptake of all bone lesions, which was considered a partial response in the femur, tibia, calcaneus, and talus. To date, pazopanib has shown no relevant toxicities. PET-CT performed in October 2023 confirmed an ongoing partial response to pazopanib. Figure 4 shows the timeline of all treatments received by the patient.\nFigure 4. Timeline of diagnostic tests and therapy.\n\nPR: partial response; DP: disease progressive.\nOpen in a new tab\nThe case has been reported in line with the CARE guidelines for case reports.(7)\nThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (CAAE: 77048623.6.0000.0071; #6, 647, 377).\nDISCUSSION\nThe diagnosis and management of ultra-rare sarcomas are challenging for pathologists, orthopedic surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists.(8–10) Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is an ultra-rare indolent vascular tumor initially described as \"pseudomyogenic (fibroma-like) variant of epithelioid sarcoma\" due to the lack of histologic evidence of vascular differentiation.(11) Later, with additional immunohistochemical analyses, clinical recognition, and molecular diagnostics, this entity was better characterized.(12)\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is commonly diagnosed in young adults, with a male predominance of 4–5:1, and a mean age of 30 years.(13) Lower extremities are the most common sites of involvement (54%), as shown in this case report; however, other anatomic primary sites have been described.(1) This clinical entity exhibits locally aggressive behavior in most cases. Moreover, multifocality is present in 66% of the cases, and bone involvement is reported in one-quarter of the patients. Multiple anatomical planes, such as the dermis, subcutis, and skeletal muscle, are involved in >90% of cases with multifocality, as was the case in our patient.(14) The pattern of bone lesions is characterized by cortical and intramedullary lytic lesions with well-defined borders, without signs of local aggressiveness, and a low risk of metastatic disease.(15)\nThe diagnosis is challenging because of the rarity of this condition. In the largest reported series, the duration of symptoms before excision ranged from to 1-24 months (mean, 7 months). In the present case, the time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4 months, which is in line with the literature. Potential differential diagnoses include vascular tumors, such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid angiosarcoma, and non-vascular lesions, such as metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma. Consequently, a comprehensive diagnostic approach consistent with imaging (radiological, magnetic resonance imaging, and PET-CT), in addition to pathological findings, is relevant for a correct diagnosis.(16)\nHistopathologically, the tumor was characterized by epithelioid-to-spindle endothelial cells with dense eosinophilic cytoplasm, few intracytoplasmic lumens, and no apparent vascular differentiation. These components present with mild-to-moderate cytological atypia, low mitotic activity, and admixed neutrophils. Immunophenotype patterns usually show strong positivity for keratin, Fli-1, and ERG, frequently positive for CD31 but negative for CD34; nuclear expression of SMARCB1 (INI-1) is retained.(17) The t(7;19) (q22;q13) translocation has been described in most PMH cases, leading to a fusion between SERPINE1 and FOSB.(18) In addition, other FOSB fusion partners have been described, such as ACTB,(19) WWTR1,(20) CLTC,(21) EGFL7(22) and POTE1.(23,24)\nThe recurrence pattern was mostly localized. Local recurrences and additional nodules in the same anatomic region have been reported in approximately 60% of patients with this diagnosis, usually within the first 2 years after the excision of the primary tumor.(11) The standard treatment for PMH is local excision and/or curettage, although retrospective data have shown a significant percentage of amputations (20.7%).(16) Notably, metastases are rare. In a large series of 50 patients, only one patient developed metastatic disease; however, long-term follow-up data are necessary to assess the frequency of late metastasis.(1)\nEvidence of the efficacy of systemic therapy for PMH is limited. In recent case reports and small case series, chemotherapy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, anti-resorptive bone therapies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been investigated as treatment options, particularly for multifocal or recurrent lesions.(25–29) Table 3 presents a literature review of case reports on the systemic treatment of PMH.\nTable 3.

SERPINE1 encodes a protein within the serine protease inhibitor family, known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). It has been documented that PAI-1 inhibits apoptosis by triggering the Akt pathway. Therefore, mTOR inhibitors are promising therapeutic targets in this setting.(36,37) Ozeki et al. evaluated the efficacy of this agent in the treatment of PMH. A pediatric patient with high mTOR expression in PMH tissue showed a partial response to everolimus.(26) Moreover, Joseph et al.(25) treated a pediatric patient with everolimus and PMH, revealing a tuberous sclerosis 1(TSC1) mutation. TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressors that inhibit Rheb, a small GTPase essential for mTOR activation.(38)\nJoseph et al.(25) reported the only case with an actionable mutation in DNA sequencing with a partial response to targeted treatment. Despite performing next-generation sequencing, we did not find any genomic alterations in our patient's tumor, and only variants of uncertain significance were identified. Therefore, the treatment the patient received was not targeted to any specific mutations but was based on previously reported drugs used for this disease.(38)\nDenosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets RANK ligands and has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, bone metastasis, and giant cell tumors.(39) Otani et al. treated a single case of PMH of the bone with monthly denosumab administration, which resulted in symptomatic relief of ankle pain.(28) Pasricha et al. used a six-weekly basis Denosumab protocol to achieve stable disease and symptomatic relief after 6 months.(29)\nAs our patient showed disease progression with denosumab and significant toxicity with everolimus, the second-line treatment was pazopanib. The efficacy of TKIs has been described in two previous case reports. The first study to use pazopanib was conducted by Alkanash et al. A 35-year-old male with PMH in his right lower limb was treated with first-line pazopanib and achieved a sustained partial response for 6 months after treatment initiation.(32) Van Jzendoorne et al. described the case of a 17-year-old male who had multiple skin lesions on the head and neck, was diagnosed with PMH, and was treated with telatinib, a multi-tyrosine inhibitor. He had a complete response and continued to use the drug for 9 years when the treatment was stopped because of the unavailability of the drug. Four years after having stopped the medication discontinuation, the patient remained in complete response. In addition, this group created a model using normal endothelial cells, the most likely precursors of PMH, expressing the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion. This fusion product can control the expression and enhance PDGFRA and FLT1 levels. In this model, telatinib effectively inhibited the surface receptors FLT1, FLT4, and PDGFRA and disrupted the self-regulated expression of the fusion product. Consequently, telatinib and other TKIs can indirectly affect the expression of SERPINE1-FOSB and may serve as important therapeutic options for individuals with multifocal, unresectable PMH.(33)\nCONCLUSION\nFurther studies are required to determine the optimal dose, duration, and sequence of systemic therapies for pseudomyogenic hemangioendotheliomas. Here, we describe a case of sequential therapy with everolimus, denosumab, and pazopanib. Our report highlights that the use of systemic therapy in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma represents a significant option for the management of this rare and challenging tumor, especially in cases where surgical resection is not feasible or has resulted in local recurrence or metastasis.\nREFERENCES\n\n1.Hornick JL, Fletcher CD.

This study aimed at (i) utilizing a patient-derived xenograft model of EHE and its associated cell line to assess the efficacy of sirolimus and (ii) analyzing two distinct patient cohorts to pinpoint circulating biomarkers of EHE aggressiveness.\nExperimental Design:\nA patient-derived xenograft model and corresponding cell line were established from a patient with advanced EHE, demonstrating consistency with the original tumor in terms of histomorphology, WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion presence, and genomic and transcriptomic profiles. Two independent patient series were employed to investigate the association between growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) serum levels and EHE aggressiveness.\nResults:\nELISA analyses on EHE cell culture medium and blood from EHE-carrying mice revealed the release of GDF-15 by EHE cells. Sirolimus exhibited markedly higher antitumor activity compared with doxorubicin, concurrently reducing GDF-15 expression/release both in vivo and in vitro. This reduction was attributed to the drug-induced inhibition of phosphorylation/activation of 4E-BP1 and subsequent downregulation of the GDF-15 transcription factors ATF4 and ATF5. Blood sample analyses from two independent patient series showed a significant correlation between GDF-15 and EHE aggressiveness.\nConclusions:\nThis study identifies GDF-15 as a novel biomarker of EHE aggressiveness and underscores the superior efficacy of sirolimus compared with doxorubicin in our experimental models. The observed inhibition of GDF-15 release by sirolimus suggests its potential as a biomarker for monitoring the drug’s activity in patients.\nTranslational Relevance.\nThis study exploited a patient-derived xenograft and the paired cell line of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), a YAP/TAZ-driven ultrarare sarcoma, and found that EHE cells produce and release growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a member of the TGFβ superfamily. Results indicate that the assessment of circulating GDF-15 holds promise of refining risk stratification of patients with EHE. Additionally, the evidence that sirolimus downregulates the expression/release of GDF-15 in EHE models suggests the possibility for the cytokine to be used for defining sirolimus effectiveness and detecting disease progression in patients with EHE. Moreover, the patient-derived xenograft we established in this study from a patient with EHE characterized by high-risk features and that maintains the molecular profile of the originating clinical sample represents a valuable model to generate preclinical findings and hypotheses to be translated to the clinic with the aim to improve the management of higher risk patients.\nIntroduction\nEpithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is an ultrarare and translocated vascular sarcoma that exhibits endothelial differentiation (1–4). In 90% of EHE cases, a fusion involving the WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1)/transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ-motif (TAZ) and the calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1) genes has been identified (5), whereas approximately 10% of tumors display a fusion between yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcription factor E3 (TFE3) genes, known as YAP-TFE3 (1). These fusion proteins WWTR1(TAZ)CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 drive a unique transcriptome by simultaneously hyperactivating a TEA domain (TEAD)–dependent transcriptional program and modulating the chromatin environment through interactions with the Ada2a-containing histone acetyltransferase (ATAC) complex (6). Forced activation of YAP/TAZ is believed to be the driving factor in EHE (7, 8). Additionally, secondary genomic alterations characterize approximately half of EHE, including mutations in CDKN2A/b, RB, APC, ATRX, XRCC2, and FANCA (9, 10).\nPatients with EHE lack tumor biomarkers to refine their prognostic risk stratification and effective tumor-specific treatment options, particularly for patients with highly aggressive disease. Indeed, more than half of all patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and the behavior of EHE can display significant variability, spanning from a relatively indolent course to an exceptionally aggressive one. Indicators that suggest a less-favorable prognosis, include the extent of disease, involvement of serosal membranes and the presence of paraneoplastic signs and symptoms, such as pleural effusions, fever, weight loss, asthenia, and severe tumor-related pain (4, 11). Conventional anthracycline-based chemotherapy and other systemic agents available for the treatment of advanced sarcomas have marginal activity in EHE (3, 12, 13). The highest clinical activity has been reported so far, but only retrospectively, for the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (3, 13, 14).\nProgress in the understanding of EHE biology and identification of new therapeutic targets have been limited, beyond disease rarity, by the lack of patient-derived models that recapitulate the genomic complexity of this tumor beyond genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM; refs. 7, 8).\nGrowth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a member of the TGFβ superfamily and is mainly found in the placenta and prostate under normal conditions, although it is induced by various stress signals (15–17). Elevated GDF-15 levels are associated with inflammatory conditions, myocardial ischemia, autoimmune diseases, and various cancer types (17). In cancers, elevated GDF-15 levels are often associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor outcome (18–21). In sarcomas, GDF-15 expression is elevated in metastatic osteosarcoma, linked to reduced survival, and promotes cell migration through the TGF-β pathway (22). Additionally, GDF-15 may serve as a serum biomarker to distinguish uterine sarcomas from leiomyomas (23).\nUtilizing a recently established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of EHE and its corresponding cell line obtained from a patient with an aggressive form of EHE characterized by severe inflammatory symptoms, which is to the best of our knowledge the first patient-derived model of this disease, our research demonstrates that EHE cells produce and secrete GDF-15. Furthermore, the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus modulates the secretion of GDF-15 by downregulating ATF4 and ATF5 transcription factors. In patients, GDF-15 serves as a predictive marker for the aggressiveness of EHE and holds implications for monitoring the effectiveness of sirolimus as a treatment option for patients with EHE, especially in the more aggressive cases marked by serosal involvement and symptom deterioration.\nMaterials and Methods\nDevelopment of PDX and PDX-derived cell line\nThe EHE PDX and the corresponding cell line were derived from an aggressive form of EHE with an unbalanced WWTR1::CAMTA1 translocation. A detailed description of the clinical tumor is reported in Supplementary Material S1.\nThe EHE PDX was generated from fresh EHE specimen collected immediately after surgical resection from the previously described patient. Clinical tumor was aseptically dissected, cut into ∼3-mm3 fragments and incubated in Matrigel at 4°C for 30 minutes (Cultrex Basement Membrane Extract, Type 3, Pathclear, Bio-Techne srl). At least five fragments were grafted subcutaneously into the right flank of 6-week-old female CB17/lcr-Prkdcscid (SCID, RRID: IMSR_ARC:SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratories, RRID: SCR_003792). Tumor growth was followed by biweekly measurement of tumor diameters with a Vernier caliper, and tumor weight (TW) was calculated according to the formula TW = d2 × D/2, in which d and D represent the shortest and the longest diameters, respectively. After the third passage in mice, the PDX was considered established. Detailed description for PDX generation and evaluation of tumor growth are reported elsewhere (24, 25).\nSCID mice were maintained in a pathogen-free facility where temperature and humidity were kept constant and had free access to food and water. Mice’s weight was routinely monitored during and after drug treatment for the whole experiment.\nThe use of patient material to generate the PDX model was approved by the institutional ethical committee (INT-139/17 and INT-174/20) and the patient consented. Generation of PDX and in vivo drug experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health (project approval code: 234/2018-PR and 104/2023-PR) in compliance with international policies and guidelines (Italian implementation of Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes). Detailed description for PDX generation and evaluation of tumor growth are reported elsewhere (24, 25) and detailed in Supplementary Material S1.\nThe EHE cell line was generated in our laboratory. On April 2021, the PDX at the fifth passage was cut into pieces of ∼ 1 mm3 and enzymatically digested with collagenase (200 U/mL; Collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum, Merck, RRID: SCR_001287) in free-serum DMEM/F-12 for 3 hours at 37°C. Cells were resuspended in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM/F-12 complete medium) to inactivate collagenase and applied to a cell strainer (100 µm, Corning), centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 minutes, and resuspended in DMEM/F-12 complete medium. Tumor cells were then propagated in DMEM/F-12 complete medium and maintained in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. This cell line was established after 10 passages (July 2021) based on its constant growth pattern and doubling time (25 ± 3 hours). At this passage, we performed single tandem repeat analysis by the AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems, RRID: SCR_005039) to authenticate this cell line. The established cell line was not contaminated by murine cells as indicated by the assessment of species-specific beta-2-microglobulin through RT-PCR. Cells were periodically tested for Mycoplasma (MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit, LT07-318, Lonza, RRID: SCR_000377).\nThe cell-based experiments reported in the article have been carried out at passages 11 to 20. The authentication of PDX and its corresponding cell line was performed through microsatellite analysis by the AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR amplification kit (Applied Biosystems, RRID: SCR_005039).\nThe EHE cell line was characterized for the presence WWTR1(TAZ)-CAMTA1 fusion by FISH analysis. The cell line was tumorigenic and able to generate palpable tumors 1 week after injection of 5 × 106 cells into the flanks of SCID mice.\nPDX characterization\nThe consistency of the EHE PDX with the originating clinical tumor was assessed in terms of histomorphology, presence of the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion, and genomic and transcriptomic profiles. Doubling time of EHE PDX is around 26 days (Supplementary Fig. S1).\nFour-micrometer sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue obtained from the patient’s surgical specimen and sacrificed mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for morphological evaluation and Ki67 (1:400, Ab Ki67, Clone Mib1, Agilent, Cat. #GA626, RRID: AB_2687921). IHC analysis was performed at room temperature on the Dako Autostainer Link 48 AS480 (Agilent, RRID: SCR_013575), as previously described (26). The IHC slides were scanned at 10× magnification. The digital images of Ki67 expression were analyzed using the open-source DIA software QuPath software v. 0.1.2 (RRID: SCR_018257). The Ki67 labeling index was expressed as number of Ki67-positive nuclei/overall number of nuclei × 100.\nPathologists with expertise in soft-tissue sarcomas compared morphologic features of human and PDX tumors.\nFISH was performed on 2-µm FFPE tumor sections with a commercially available probe for TFE3 (ZytoLight SPEC TFE3 break-apart probe; ZytoVision) and in-house labeled bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones for WWTR1 (RP11-941L15 and RP11-1151O19) and CAMTA1 (RP11-1114C18; RP11-1120I14, RP11-338N10, and RP11-60J11). The BAC clones were obtained from the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute BACPAC Resource Center and labeled to produce a WWTR1 dual-color break-apart probe and a WWTR1::CAMTA1 dual-color dual fusion probe.\nA commercially available MET/centromere seven dual-color probe and a dual-color WT1(11p11.3)/FLI1(11q24.3) in the house-made BAC probe were used to validate differentially expressed copy-number variations (CNV) in tumor relative to PDX.\nDNA was isolated from FFPE EHE clinical and PDX samples using the GeneRead DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, RRID: SCR_008539) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., RRID: SCR_008452), and DNA quality was assessed by TapeStation 4200 (Agilent 4200 TapeStation System, RRID: SCR_018435). The OncoScan CNV Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was implemented following the manufacturer’s instructions to detect genome-wide copy-number gains and losses, loss of heterozygosity, including copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, and a panel of somatic mutations. Data were visualized with the karyoploteR tool implemented into R.\nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen EHE clinical and PDX samples with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The concentration and the purity of the RNA starting material were measured on a spectrophotometer, and RNA integrity number was measured on an Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Agilent 4200 TapeStation System, RRID: SCR_018435, Agilent Technologies). cDNA libraries were synthesized from 200 ng total RNA with an RNA Prep Kit with Tagmentation (Illumina, Agilent Technologies, RRID: SCR_013575) and quantified by Qubit Assay (Thermo Fisher Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer Qubit 2.0, RRID: SCR_020553). After the quality control performed with the fastQC tool (RRID: SCR_014583), sequences were aligned using STAR (RRID: SCR_004463) against the human reference genome hg38. Read counts were determined according to the protocol used for library preparation. Raw data were normalized using the trimmed mean of Mvalue, according to the edgeR (RRID: SCR_012802) package of the R environment, and filtered, discarding reads under the 10th percentile of expression variance across samples and lacking an associated official gene symbol. Reads mapping on the same gene symbol were collapsed, summing their counts. The gene expression matrix and the preprocessing pipeline were deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE246152, RRID: SCR_005012). The correlation between the gene expression profiles of PDX and clinical tumor was evaluated with the Spearman coefficient in order to detect a possible nonlinear relationship.\nDrug activity studies\nFor in vitro studies, doxorubicin (Adriblastina, RRID: SCR_025575, Accord Healthcare) was diluted in sterile saline solution before use. Sirolimus (Rapamycin, MedChemExpress), was dissolved and diluted in DMSO (0.5% final concentration in culture medium). Exponentially growing cells were treated, the day after seeding, with increasing drug concentrations for 6 days. The antiproliferative activity was evaluated by cell counting using a Coulter counter (Z Series Coulter Counter, Beckman Coulter GmbH, RRID: SCR_008940). Drug concentrations able to inhibit cell proliferation by 50% (IC50) were calculated from dose–response curves. Cells treated with solvent (DMSO at 0.5% final concentration in culture medium) was used as control.\nFor in vivo studies, when tumor burden reached about 100 to 120 mm3, SCID mice were randomized to receive different treatments. Each experimental group consisted of nine mice; six mice were used to assess the drug effect on tumor growth over time, whereas three mice were sacrificed after the end of treatment to collect blood from mice, to carry out hematoxylin and eosin, Ki67, and Western blot analysis.\nMice were treated with doxorubicin (Adriblastina, Accord Healthcare, RRID: SCR_025575) after dilution in saline solution. Sirolimus (Rapamycin, MedChemExpress, DBA) was dissolved in aqueous vehicle solution containing 2% ethanol, 10% of PEG-400, and Tween-80 solution 1:1 (v/v). Drugs were administered at dosages and schedules as reported in Supplementary Table S1. Mice treated with vehicle solution were used as control.\nEach TW measure was normalized to the TW of the same mouse at the start of treatment (RTW), and treatment efficacy was evaluated in the normalized TW curve of individual mice as TW inhibition percentage (TWI%) at nadir.\nSmall interfering RNA–mediated gene knockdown\nHuman GDF-15 small interfering RNA [siRNA; Silencer Select Pre-designed siRNA ID: 18258 (#2); ID: 18259 (#1) and 228510 (#3)] was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., whereas human ATF4 [ON-TARGETplus SMART pool siRNA (468) ID: L-008822-00-0005] and human ATF5 [ON-TARGETplus SMART pool siRNA (22809) ID: L-005125-00-0005] were purchased from Dharmacon (Horizon Discovery, Carlo Erba Reagents Srl).\nOne day after seeding EHE cells were exposed to each siRNA (33 nmol/L) for 24 hours in free-serum DMEM/F-12 using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc.) as a transfecting agent. A control siRNA (Silencer Select Negative Control #2 siRNA, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. or On-TARGET plus Non-targeting Pool, Dharmacon) with no homology to any known human mRNA was used as transfection control. Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, cells were maintained either in complete medium for different intervals and then assessed for the expression of siRNA target genes as well as for their proliferative potential or in serum-free medium for the assessment of GDF-15 release.\nTo investigate the role of GDF-15 in tumor growth, EHE cells were transfected with GDF-15 or negative control siRNA according to the protocol described above. Twenty-four hours after the end of transfection, 5 × 106 cells/SCID mouse were injected subcutaneously in 100 μL of serum-free medium and Matrigel (Cultrex Basement Membrane Extract, Type 3; 1:2 ratio).\nTranscriptomic profile of EHE cells after siRNA-mediated GDF-15 knockdown\nTotal RNA extracted at different time intervals from cells transfected with GDF-15 siRNA or control siRNA was processed according to standard NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, RRID: SCR_013517) for Illumina protocol, and mRNA was selected with oligo-dT beads starting from 800 ng of total RNA. Libraries were quantified and quality checked on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation system (High Sensitivity D5000, Agilent Technologies), and then sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform (Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System, RRID: SCR_016387) with paired-end reads 150 bp long, with a depth of 27 million cluster/sample.\nDifferential expression analysis was performed by removing data heteroscedasticity with the voom method implemented into the edgeR package. A linear model was employed to evaluate differentially expressed genes using the limma package (LIMMA, RRID: SCR_010943; ref. 27), measuring both the fold change (FC), logarithmically (base 2) transformed, and the t-statistic. Taking into account multiple comparisons to assess significant changes, a threshold of 0.05 was considered for the FDR P value correction. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on the hallmark collection of the Molecular Signatures Database, and genes were ranked according to the t-statistic as implemented into the GSEA package (RRID: SCR_003199). An FDR threshold of 0.05 was applied to assess significant enrichments.\nWestern blot analysis\nLysates were obtained from exponentially growing cells and from frozen xenotransplants after pulverization by the Mikro-Dismembrator II (B. Brown Biotech International).Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti–GDF-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. # sc-377195, RRID: AB_2895563), anti–phospho-mTOR (Ser2448, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. # sc-293133, RRID: AB_2861149), anti-mTOR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. # sc-517464, RRID: AB_3186240), anti–phospho-p70 (Thr389, Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. # 9205, RRID: AB_330944), anti-p70 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. # 9202, RRID: AB_331676), anti–phospho-4E-BP1 (Ser65, Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. # 9451, RRID: AB_330947), anti–4E-BP1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. # 9644, RRID: AB_2097841), anti-ATF4 (Abcam, Cat. # ab184909, RRID: AB_2819059), anti-ATF5 (Abcam, Cat. #ab184923, RRID: AB_2800462), and anti-vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. # V9131, RRID: AB_477629). Horseradish peroxidase–linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. # 7074, RRID: AB_2099233) or horseradish peroxidase–linked horse anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. # 7076, RRID: AB_330924) antibodies were used to detect primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ECL (GE Healthcare, RRID: SCR_000004).\nThe membranes were cut to allow simultaneous incubation of primary antibodies detecting proteins with different molecular weights on the same membrane. Membranes were stripped and reincubated with different primary antibodies and successively with the specific peroxidase secondary antibodies. For the preparation of figures, we cropped original film Western blot images to generate a unique panel with different proteins. Molecular massed were detected using the Precision Plus Protein Standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories, RRID: SCR_008426). Quantification of band intensities for each blot of in the article is reported in Supplementary Tables S1–S3.\nProteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array\nThe Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (ARY022B, R&D Systems Inc., RRID: SCR_006140) was used to screen plasma of patients with EHE and healthy donors, as well as serum-free medium of EHE cells, for a large panel of secreted proteins. Spots array were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ECL (GE Healthcare). Chemiluminescence spots were analyzed to find the first evidence of saturation on the reference spot.\nELISA\nLevels of human GDF-15 were measured by using a Quantikine ELISA Kit (R and D Systems Cat# DGD150, RRID:AB_2877710) in plasma samples collected from patients with EHE and healthy donors as well as in plasma from of mice carrying the EHE xenotransplants and in the serum-free medium of EHE cells. Mouse blood (approximately 300–500 µL/mouse) was collected under deep terminal anesthesia by cardiac puncture. For comparative purposes, plasma from mice carrying pleomorphic sarcoma xenografts as well as serum-free culture medium of pleomorphic sarcoma, dedifferentiated sarcoma, angiosarcoma, and normal endothelial cell (HUVEC, RRID: CVCL_2959) lines were analyzed. The optical density of the wells was determined with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader, RRID: SCR_023799, Bio-Rad) set to 450 nm. GDF-15 concentrations were measured in duplicate samples. The values from each assay were extrapolated from a standard curve fit. As plasma samples and conditioned medium were diluted, the concentration read from the standard curve was multiplied for dilution factor to obtain the final pg/mL concentration.\nRT-qPCR\nTotal RNA was extracted with the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) from cells transfected with gene-specific siRNAs.\nOne microgram total RNA was reverse-transcribed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (4368814, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Gene expression levels were assessed by RT-qPCR using specific TaqMan assays (GDF-15: Hs.PT.58.40089589, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.; ATF4: Hs.PT.56a.744435.g; and ATF5: Hs.PT.58.25040399, Integrated Technology Enterprise Inc., RRID: SCR_012186). Amplifications were run in the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). GAPDH was used as housekeeping control gene (Hs.PT.39a.22214836 Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Data were reported as relative quantity (RQ = 2−ΔΔCt): being ΔCt the difference between the threshold cycle (Ct) of the target gene and the Ct of the housekeeping gene and ΔΔCt the difference between ΔCt of the sample and ΔCt of the calibrator. The calibrator corresponded to the sample transfected with control (NEG) siRNA.\nMigration and invasion\nCell migratory capability was assessed through the wound healing assay by analyzing cell ability to close a gap in the culture monolayer. Six days after siRNA transfection, EHE cells were seeded in two well silicone inserts with a defined cell-free gap (80209, ibidi). Twenty-four hours after seeding, inserts were removed and fresh complete medium was added. Images were captured by phase-contrast microscopy immediately after insert removal (t0) and 24 hours later (t24 hours).\nThe invasion ability of cells was assessed using the Transwell permeable supports (8.0 μm Polycarbonate Membrane, 6.5 mm Insert; #3422, Corning) coated with Matrigel (#356231, Corning). Six days after siRNA transfection, EHE cells were seeded in the upper chamber in free-serum medium, whereas the lower chamber was filled with of complete medium. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells that passed through the microporous membrane invading the Matrigel were fixed to the filter with 100% ethanol, stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (Merck) in 1% acetic acid, and washed. Images of five random fields per chamber were captured by phase-contrast microscopy and quantified using the ImageJ 1.47q software (RRID: SCR_003070).\nPatient cohorts and blood collection\nTwo series of patients with EHE were analyzed, the retrospective (training cohort) and the prospective (testing cohort) ones.\nThe retrospective cohort included 20 patients with a diagnosis of EHE who had a consultation at the Department of Cancer Medicine of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori (INT) and had their blood sampled (April 2019 to January 2020). Blood samples were also collected from 32 healthy patients (21 female/11 male) with a median age of 35 years (range 21–57).\nThe prospective study included 21 consecutive adult patients with centrally reviewed and molecularly confirmed pathologic diagnosis of EHE seen at INT and Royal Marsden Cancer Centre, London, UK eligible for an international, observational prospective study on EHE (INT174/20). Detailed information on this clinical trial as well as the criteria used to define lower and higher risk patients are reported in Supplementary Material S1. All procedures performed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Blood samples were also collected from an additional 32 healthy patients (17 female/15 male) with a median age of 49 years (range 20–58). All patients enrolled in the two cohorts gave their written informed consent to participate in this collection of data and samples.\nWhole blood samples were collected into sterile BD Vacutainer K2EDTA tubes (Becton Dickinson), centrifuged, aliquoted plasma, and stored at −80°C until use.\nStatistical analysis\nIn the retrospective patient series, a single blood sample was available to assess the level of the GDF-15. In the clinical trial (prospective cohort), the GDF-15 expression level used for the analysis corresponded to (i) the last measurement, if the patient was always been at low risk; (ii) the first measurement, if the patient was always been at high risk; and (iii) the first measurement at high risk, if the patient switched from low to high risk during the follow-up.\nThe analyses were performed within each cohort, because of different recruitment periods, and overall at the end of the process. GDF-15 expression levels were compared between healthy donors and patients. Subsequently, higher risk patients were separated from lower-risk patients, in order to study GDF-15 according to tumor risk. Wilcoxon nonparametric test and two-tailed t test were used for the within cohort analyses and the overall analysis, respectively. An internal validation was performed by using the bootstrap method because of the small sample size in the comparison between higher and lower risk patients. Only resamples with at least 10 high-risk patients were included in the procedure (28).\nThe statistical analysis of differences between recorded variables in the performed experiments was performed with GraphPad Prism software version 9.4 (GraphPad Software Inc., RRID: SCR_002798). The P values were calculated using two-tailed paired t test or one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test. Comparisons reaching P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nData availability\nTranscriptomic data of EHE tumor and the paired PDX as well of EHE cell line transfected with GDF-15 or control siRNA were deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE246152). All other relevant data generated during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nResults\nGDF-15 was released by tumor cells in patient-derived models of EHE\nGDF-15 is known to be released by a variety of cell types (29), including tumor cells of different histologies (15–17). To assess whether EHE cells produce and secrete GDF-15, a human EHE PDX model was generated together with its derived cell line. This PDX properly recapitulated the histologic and molecular findings of the originating clinical tumor. Specifically, both tumors were characterized by the presence of a solid growth pattern, focal marked cytologic atypia, and areas with abundant spindle cells or necrosis (Fig. 1A). FISH analysis revealed the presence of the pathognomonic unbalanced WWTR1::CAMTA1 unbalanced translocation (Fig. 1B). Genomic analysis of the clinical EHE and PDX revealed similar profiles with gain and loss in several chromosomes (Fig. 1C). Both clinical tumor and PDX were characterized by CDKN2A loss, one of the most common secondary genomic alterations in EHE (Supplementary Fig. S2; refs. 7, 8). Interestingly, in both the tumor and the PDX, the first hit is represented by a large ch9p deletion (Fig. 1C), involving the 9.p21 locus that includes the CDKN2A gene, whereas the second hit in the tumor is represented by a further genomic deletion (135 Kb deletion) leading to homozygous loss. In the PDX, the second hit is represented by the pathologic mutation c.238C>T p.Arg80Ter. However, some differences in the chromosomal architecture of the PDX compared with the clinical sample were observed mainly in chromosomes 1, 7, and 11. For instance, the 7q31.1q31.31 region was duplicated in the clinical tumor and deleted in the PDX. This was confirmed by FISH analysis, showing a tandem duplication of MET in the clinical tumor and the loss of the duplicated region in the xenograft that leads to the CNV profile observed (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Again, the 11p/11q copy-number profile indicated that the CNV ratio 11p/11q was unbalanced in the clinical tumor, with a relative loss of 11q, and balanced in the PDX. This was confirmed by FISH using a dual-color WT1(11p11.3)/FLI1(11q24.3) probe (Supplementary Fig. S3B).\n\nCharacterization of EHE PDX and paired cell line. Representative pictures of the EHE clinical sample and corresponding EHE PDX model. A, The histology was assessed on hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides. Scale bar, 100 µm.

B, Genomic profile of EHE clinical tumor (left) and PDX (right). C, Loss (blue) and gain (red) were depicted in the top. LOH (green) was reported in the bottom (scale bar, 10 µm).

E, Morphology of the EHE cell line derived from the PDX growing as monolayer (left, scale bar, 250 µm) and confirmation of WWTR1::CAMTA1 translocation at FISH analysis (right, scale bar, 10 µm). H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; RNA-seq, RNA sequencing.\nRNA sequencing revealed a highly significant correlation of the transcriptomic profiles of the clinical tumor and the PDX (rs = 0.916; P < 0.001; Fig. 1D). The gene expression profiles of both PDX and clinical sample clustered together with those of EHE clinical samples analyzed in two publicly available datasets (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Consistent with the clinical tumor, the EHE PDX expressed high levels of ERG and CD31 (PECAM1) transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S4B). However, GSEA (RRID: SCR_003199) revealed differences between the PDX and clinical tumor in some gene sets related to angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition and KRAS-up signaling (Supplementary Fig. S4C).\nThe translocation of WWTR1::CAMTA1 was also confirmed in the PDX-derived EHE cell line by FISH analysis (Fig. 1E).\nUsing the Human XL Cytokine Array on EHE cell serum-free medium, we found the presence of GDF-15 among the different released cytokines (Fig. 2A). The quantitative analysis of EHE cell culture medium by ELISA confirmed the presence of released GDF-15 (Fig. 2B). Analysis performed in the culture medium of primary cell lines we generated from patients with soft-tissue sarcoma histologies other than EHE, such as pleomorphic liposarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, or angiosarcoma, as well as of a normal endothelial cell line (HUVEC) showed a lack or a negligible level of released GDF-15 (Fig. 2B). Consistently with in vitro results, the presence of released GDF-15 was observed to a variable extent in the blood of a panel of mice carrying EHE xenotransplants of different size but not in healthy mice and in those carrying pleomorphic liposarcoma xenotransplants (Fig. 2C).\n\nGDF-15 was released by tumor cells in patient-derived models of EHE. A, Assessment of released cytokines in the culture medium of EHE cells using the Human XL Cytokine Array. Detection of GDF-15 by ELISA in culture medium of EHE cell lines and cell lines of PLPS and DDLPS-1 and -2. B, Data were normalized as amount (pg) of released GDF-15 to total released (mg) proteins. RT-qPCR and ELISA results are reported as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. C, Detection of GDF-15 by ELISA in the plasma of healthy mice and mice carrying EHE PDX or PLPS PDX. D, siRNA-mediated downregulation of GDF-15 in the EHE cell line as detected at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR (left), protein level by Western blotting (middle), and as cytokine released in cell culture medium by ELISA 3 days after transfection (right). ELISA data were normalized as amount (pg) of released GDF-15 to total released (mg) proteins and reported as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. E, GSEA (RRID: SCR_003199) was employed on Hallmark (H) collection of the Molecular Signature Database, showing a limited number of modulated pathways following GDF-15 knockdown. DDLPS, dedifferentiated liposarcoma; PLPS, pleomorphic liposarcoma.\nTo investigate a possible role for GDF-15 in EHE cells, we transiently downregulated its expression by a siRNA (#2), which was preliminarily identified as the most efficient in downregulating GDF-15 expression among three different siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C). At 3 days after transfection, an almost complete abrogation of GDF-15 was observed at both mRNA and protein level (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Table S1), together with its markedly reduced release in cell culture medium (Fig. 2D). Such a reduced GDF-15 expression and release was still appreciable, although to a lesser extent, 10 days after transfection (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6C). RNA sequencing carried out on EHE cells transfected with either GDF-15 siRNA or control siRNA (NEG) did not reveal a profound modification of the transcriptomic profile following GDF-15 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S7), with only a few modulated, mainly downregulated, pathways as showed by GSEA (Fig. 2E; RRID: SCR_003199). Consistently, GDF-15 silencing did not impair the proliferative, migration, and invasion potential of EHE cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8C). Moreover, GDF-15 knockdown did not modify the ability of EHE cells to growth as tumor xenografts in mice (Supplementary Fig. S8D).\nSirolimus downmodulated GDF-15 release in patient-derived models of EHE\nBased on the notion that GDF-15 is a mitokine induced in the context of an integrated mitochondrial stress response driven by the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1; ref. 30) and that the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus is the best treatment option for patients with EHE requiring systemic treatment (3, 14), we assessed the effect of sirolimus in our EHE models. In the EHE cell line, sirolimus was more active that doxorubicin, the standard first-line chemotherapeutic agent for soft-tissue sarcomas, as indicated by the lower concentration able to inhibit cell growth by 50% (IC50: 0.03 vs. 0.10 µmol/L; Fig. 3A). In the EHE PDX model, doxorubicin showed a negligible activity, whereas sirolimus induced a maximum tumor weight inhibition (mTWI) of 68% to 81% as a function of its dose (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S4). Tumors started to regrow after the end of treatment with 1 and 2.5 mg/kg sirolimus, whereas 5 mg/kg sirolimus resulted in a delayed tumor regrowth (Fig. 3B). The histomorphologic analysis of tumors excised from drug-treated and untreated mice showed that tumors treated with sirolimus had post treatment changes, such as sclerojalinosis together with tumor necrosis (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S9). The latter characteristic seems likely tumor-related as it could be detected both in controls and tumors treated with doxorubicin. The proliferation rate, as detected by Ki67 index in the same tumors, indicated a marked reduction (P < 0.001) in the percentage of proliferating cells after treatment with sirolimus but not doxorubicin (Fig. 3D). Western blot carried out on EHE cells and xenografts confirmed the downregulation of the mTOR downstream signaling pathway after sirolimus treatment (Fig. 3E; Supplementary Table S2).\n\nSirolimus inhibited the growth of patient-derived models of EHE. A, Cell growth inhibition curves obtained after exposure to different doses of doxorubicin or sirolimus. Data are reported as the percentage of drug-treated cells compared with control cells and represent mean ± SD of three independent experiments. B, Growth curves reporting the RTW (mean ± SEM) in control and doxorubicin- or sirolimus-treated mouse groups (nine mice/group), in which 1 indicates the tumor weight at the beginning of the treatment.

D, Ki67 immunostaining of tumors obtained from untreated and drug-treated mice (top) and quantification of Ki67 index (bottom). Symbols reported in the represent counted fields. Histomorphologic analysis and Ki67 immunostaining were performed on tumors excised from mice at the end of drug treatment. Scale bar, 100 μm. Data are reported as means ± SD of three independent experiments.

Cropped images of selected proteins are shown. RTW, relative tumor weight.\nWe then assessed whether sirolimus affected release of GDF-15 from EHE cells. Three-day exposure to sirolimus caused a marked, although nonstatistically significant, reduction of GDF-15 released in the culture medium of EHE cells (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, an almost complete abrogation (P < 0.001) of the levels of circulating GDF-15 was consistently observed in the blood of mice after treatment with different doses of sirolimus (Fig. 4B). These effects were observed after normalization for total released proteins for EHE cells or tumor weight for EHE PDX, suggesting a direct effect of sirolimus on released GDF-15 (Fig. 4A and B). Conversely, doxorubicin did not appreciably modify the release of GDF-15 by EHE cell both in vitro (Fig. 4A) and in vivo (Fig. 4B). Sirolimus treatment reduced GDF-15 mRNA in EHE cells (Supplementary Fig. S10A), resulting in a marked reduction of its protein levels both in EHE cells and PDX (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table S3).\n\nSirolimus downmodulated GDF-15 release in patient-derived models of EHE through the inhibition of ATF4 and ATF5. A, GDF-15 released in culture medium of control cells and cells exposed for 3 days to doxorubicin or different sirolimus concentrations as detected by ELISA. Data were normalized as amount (pg) of released GDF-15 to total released (mg) proteins and reported as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. B, GDF-15 released in the blood collected from untreated mice and after the end of treatment with doxorubicin or different sirolimus doses. Data were normalized as amount (pg) of released GDF-15 to tumor weight (g) and reported as mean ± SD of three mice/experimental group. C, Western blot analysis of GDF-15, ATF4, and ATF5 expression in untreated cells (−) and cells treated with different sirolimus concentrations for 3 days (left) and in tumors removed from untreated (−) and sirolimus-treated mice after the first round of treatment with different drug doses (right). Western blot data of GDF-15 expression obtained on tumors from three untreated mice (−) and three mice exposed to 2.5 mg/kg sirolimus. Cropped images of selected proteins are shown. D, siRNA-mediated downregulation of ATF4 (left) and ATF5 (right) in the EHE cell line as detected at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR. E, Effects of ATF4 and ATF5 downregulation on GDF-15 protein expression as detected by level by Western blotting (left) and on cytokine release in cell culture medium as measured by ELISA (right). ELISA data were normalized as amount (pg) of released GDF-15 to total released (mg) proteins and reported as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Cropped images of selected proteins are shown. F, The working model of sirolimus-induced GDF-15 downregulation. Sirolimus-induced mTORC1 inhibition led to reduced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation/activation followed by decreased ATF4 and ATF5 expression, thus resulting in GDF-15 downregulation. (F, Created with BioRender.com.)\nGDF-15 downmodulation by sirolimus was mediated by inhibition of ATF4 and ATF5\nBased on previous evidence showing that mTORC1 controls ATF4 expression by regulating the translation and stability of its mRNA through 4E-BPs (31) and that GDF-15 is a direct target of ATF4 (32), we evaluated whether the inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation/activation induced by sirolimus eventually affected the expression of ATF4. Western blot carried out on EHE cells exposed to different sirolimus concentrations and in tumors excised from mice treated with different sirolimus doses consistently showed a reduction in the expression of ATF4 (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table S3). A reduced expression of ATF5 was concomitantly observed (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table S3).\nAs a previous report indicated that RNAi-mediated downregulation of ATF5 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells caused a reduced expression of GDF-15 (33), we next validated both ATF4 and ATF5 as regulators of GDF-15 in EHE cells through their siRNA-mediated knockdown. Indeed, in presence of a marked downregulation of ATF4 (P = 0.0002) and ATF5 (P = 0.0001) expression (Fig. 4D), each transcription factor was able to reduce the abundance of GDF-15 in EHE cells (Fig. 4E; Supplementary Table S3) as well as its release in the culture medium (Fig. 4E). This inhibitory effect on GDF-15 expression and release was slightly enhanced following concomitant ATF4 and ATF5 knockdown. A possible model for sirolimus-induced GDF-15 downregulation is depicted in Fig. 4F. Conversely to what observed in GDF-15 downregulated cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A), siRNA-mediated ATF4/ATF5 silencing reduced EHE cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S10B), possibly as a consequence of reduced expression of ATF4/5 target genes other than GDF-15. Moreover, we evaluated the GDF-15 expression and release after the concomitant effect of sirolimus and ATF4/ATF5 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S10C and S10D), and no significant differences in the extent of GDF-15 decrease were observed.\nCirculating GDF-15 levels correlated with disease aggressiveness in patients with EHE\nTo assess the potential clinical relevance of GDF-15 for EHE, we initially carried out an exploratory qualitative analysis of circulating cytokines using the Human XL Cytokine Array on plasma samples of patients with EHE compared with healthy donors (Fig. 5A). On the basis of this finding, we assessed using a specific ELISA assay the amount of circulating GDF-15 in plasma samples in two cohorts. The former included a series of healthy individuals (N = 32) and a retrospective series of patients with EHE (N = 20), which comprises those previously assessed with the cytokine array, whereas the latter included a new series of healthy individuals (N = 32) and a prospective series of patients with EHE within a clinical observational study (N = 21). Table 1 reports the main demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients in the two cohorts. No appreciable differences were observed among the patient cohorts, with the only exception of a higher prevalence of bone and soft-tissue lesions in the prospective cohort. No association was observed between GDF-15 levels and age or sex in both patient and healthy donors.\n\nCirculating GDF-15 levels correlated with disease aggressiveness in patients with EHE. A, Analysis of circulating cytokines in plasma samples of 16 patients with EHE and four healthy donors using the Human XL Cytokine Array showed higher GDF-15 levels in patients compared with healthy donors. B, GDF-15 levels, as detected by ELISA and expressed in pg/mL plasma, in patients with EHE compared with healthy donors in a training (retrospective; 8 higher-risk and 12 lower-risk patients and 32 healthy donors) and a testing (prospective; 6 higher-risk and 15 lower-risk patients and 32 healthy donors) cohort and in both the cohorts. C, Two clinical cases are reported showing levels of GDF-15 in a lower-risk patient (top) with stable disease at follow-up and a higher-risk patient (bottom) who had an initial tumor response and levels of GDF-15 reduced after being started on the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus followed by an increase in GDF-15 before the CT scan that showed disease progression. PD, progressive disease; SD, stable disease.\nDemographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with EHE in the two study cohorts.\nResults showed a statistically significant higher expression of GDF-15 in patients with EHE compared with healthy donors in both retrospective (P < 0.001) and prospective (P < 0.001) cohorts (Fig. 5B). Patients with higher-risk EHE did show the highest levels of GDF-15 in both cohorts (retrospective cohort, P = 0.006; prospective cohort, P = 0.002; Fig. 5B), highlighting the association of GDF-15 levels with EHE aggressiveness. By analyzing the two cohorts together in order to increase the sample size, the statistically significant association between GDF-15 levels with EHE (P < 0.001) and disease aggressiveness (P < 0.03) was confirmed (Fig. 5B). The internal validation procedure, based on 89,970 bootstrap resampling, was applied on the overall analysis and the robustness of the aggressiveness results was confirmed (P < 0.001).\nTo further support the value of GDF-15 level as a biomarker of EHE aggressiveness, we reported on a higher-risk patient (Fig. 5C), who developed disease progression at the right lung together with pleural effus",

Extensive cases are treated with amputation as chemotherapy seems to be ineffective. Recently, promising results were published using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tumors of vascular origin. Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity. This case contributes to the growing evidence regarding the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, in multifocal PMH.\nKeywords: mTOR inhibition; pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; sirolimus.\n© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nEverolimus for Treatment of Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma.\nOzeki M, Nozawa A, Kanda K, Hori T, Nagano A, Shimada A, Miyazaki T, Fukao T.

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported case of PMH and the first successful and limb-sparing utilization of systemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma with bone and soft tissue involvement with favorable response to pamidronate: a case report and systematic review of the literature.\nBrance ML, Cóccaro NM, Roitman P, Castiglioni A, Agostinis F, Spense M, Scheitlin B, Rene N, Brun LR.

It is diagnosed using a combination of imaging studies, histopathological examinations, and immunohistochemical staining. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, with the goal of achieving a wide local excision and reducing the risk of recurrence. The role of systemic therapies is not well established because of the rarity of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, uncertainty regarding its response to currently approved medications, and lack of randomized controlled trials. We describe the case of an 18-year-old male patient diagnosed with multifocal pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma of the left lower limb who was treated with everolimus in addition to denosumab, achieving a partial response that was consolidated with resection, radiofrequency ablation, and radiotherapy of multiple local lesions, achieving a long-lasting response. Following subsequent disease progression, the patient responded favorably to pazopanib, with no significant toxicities.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nFigures\n \n**Figure 1.

Disease progression in the 6 months before the start of treatment was required. Each pathologic diagnosis was reviewed. The daily dose of sirolimus was adjusted based on plasma levels. Response was retrospectively assessed by local investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST). Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nResults: All 38 patients (WW Domain Containing Transcription Regulator 1 [WWTR1]-positive, n = 37; transcription factor E3 [TFE3]-positive, n = 1) had disease progression before starting sirolimus (at baseline, 13 of 38 patients had the presence of serosal effusions and systemic symptoms). Thirty-seven patients were evaluable for response (there was 1 early interruption). The best RECIST responses were a partial response in 4 patients (10.8%), stable disease in 28 patients (75.7%), and disease progression in 5 patients (13.5%). At a 41.5-month median follow-up (interquartile range [IQR], 23.9-56.8 months), the median PFS was 13 months (95% CI, 3.7 months to not estimated [NE]), and the median OS was 18.8 months (95% CI, 10.6 months to NE). In patients who had serosal effusions at baseline, the median PFS was 4.8 months (IQR, 3.5-11.7 months), and the median OS was 10.6 months (IQR, 5.1-13.0 months), compared with 47.8 months (IQR, 11.4 months to NE) and 47.8 months (IQR, 15.7 months to NE), respectively, in patients without serosal effusions. Overall, sirolimus was fairly well tolerated, with 10 patients reporting irregular menstruation/ovary disfunction.\nConclusions: The current results confirm that sirolimus is active in EHE, leading to prolonged stabilization in most patients who present without serosal effusions. Serosal effusions are confirmed as an unfavorable prognostic sign associated with short survival, and sirolimus displays limited activity in this subgroup.\nKeywords: chemotherapy; epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; metastasis; prognosis; sarcoma; serosal effusion; sirolimus.\n© 2020 American Cancer Society.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nComment in\n\n\nSirolimus for patients with progressive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\nSmrke AM, Huang PH, Jones RL.

No consensus or guideline for the therapy has been reached because of the lack of prospective trials, and the different standard care suggestions are based on retrospective case series.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      We report the case of a 9-month-old male with KHE and KMS in which the initial response, obtained with prednisone and vincristine, was subsequently consolidated and strengthened by long-term treatment with sirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor. A summary of the published data is presented as well.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The inhibition of mTOR pathway represents the most important therapeutic innovation introduced in the last few years for KHE. Our case shows the effectiveness and good tolerance of long-term therapy with sirolimus.\n    \n\n\n          Keywords:\n        \n      \n      Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma; Kasabach-Merrit syndrome; Prednisone; Sirolimus; Vincristine.\n    \n\nPubMed Disclaimer\n\n\n      Conflict of interest statement\n    \nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\n          Figures\n        \n Figure 1 \n Abdominal MRI performed at 1,… \n Figure 1 \n Abdominal MRI performed at 1, 9, 16 months.

Pathologic review and molecular analysis for WWTR1 rearrangement were performed. Sirolimus was administered until unacceptable toxicity or progression, with the dose being adjusted to reach target plasma levels of 15-20 ng/dL. Responses were assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\nResults: Since 2005, 18 patients (17 EHE, 1 retiform HE; 1 locally advanced, 17 metastatic; WWTR1 rearrangement: 16) have been identified, with 17/18 patients being evaluable for response. Mean sirolimus daily dose was 4.5 mg. According to RECIST, best responses in EHE were 1 partial response (PR), 12 stable disease (SD), and 3 progressive disease (PD); the patient with retiform HE also achieved a PR, lasting >2 years. Four patients with a reversed interval progression on interruption were observed. Median overall survival was 16 months, and median progression-free survival was 12 months (range 1-45), with four patients progression-free at 24 months. The clinical benefit (complete response [CR] + PR + SD >6 months) was 56 %. Seven patients receiving sirolimus experienced an increase in pleural/peritoneal effusion plus worsening of tumor-related symptoms; six of these patients died within 1-8 months from evidence of effusion progression, while a RECIST PD was assessed in two of seven patients.\nConclusions: A clinical benefit was achieved in 56 % of patients receiving sirolimus, which lasted >24 months in four patients. Most patients with pleural effusion did not benefit from sirolimus and had a poor outcome.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nActivity of sirolimus in patients with progressive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: A case-series analysis within the Italian Rare Cancer Network.\nStacchiotti S, Simeone N, Lo Vullo S, Baldi GG, Brunello A, Vincenzi B, Palassini E, Dagrada G, Collini P, Morosi C, Greco FG, Sbaraglia M, Dei Tos AP, Mariani L, Frezza AM, Casali PG.

The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, sirolimus, has been used successfully in adult EHE and other vascular tumors in children but has not been studied in pediatric EHE. The aim of this retrospective case series is to discuss the results of sirolimus for treatment in 6 pediatric patients with EHE. Four of 6 patients demonstrated partial response or disease stabilization with sirolimus treatment. No treatment dosing, trough goals, or duration of treatment recommendations can be made. Prospective studies are warranted to further investigate the use of sirolimus in treatment of EHE.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nSirolimus in Advanced Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma: A Retrospective Case-Series Analysis from the Italian Rare Cancer Network Database.\nStacchiotti S, Provenzano S, Dagrada G, Negri T, Brich S, Basso U, Brunello A, Grosso F, Galli L, Palassini E, Libertini M, Colia V, Gronchi A, Dei Tos AP, Crippa F, Morosi C, Pilotti S, Casali PG.

Over 50% of patients present with metastatic disease, requiring systemic therapy, although no systemic therapies are specifically approved for EHE. Retrospective evidence supports the activity of mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus), although available only off-label. EHE patients and advocates are therefore working to support approval of effective treatments by collecting data on patient perspectives and experiences.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      In February 2023, the EHE Rare Cancer Charity (UK) and The EHE Foundation (US), with other advocates, conducted a survey of perspectives and experiences of EHE patients regarding the use and accessibility of sirolimus. The survey consisted of 20 questions designed for individuals undergoing treatment, those who had been treated, or had never been treated with the drug. Widely promoted within the patient community, the online survey categorized patients into three cohorts for the analysis: liver transplant patients, non-transplant patients who had ever taken sirolimus and sirolimus-naïve non-transplant patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The survey evaluated data from 129 patient responses from 21 countries, mostly from USA, UK, Australia, and Canada (70%). The liver transplant, sirolimus and non-sirolimus cohorts were 16%, 25% and 59%, respectively. In the sirolimus group 66% reported treatment durations exceeding one year, with 16% exceeding five years, indicating the drug's efficacy. In the non-sirolimus group, the drug was not available for 42% and for 11% sirolimus was available but not selected for treatment because of its off-label status. Overall, 87% of all patients across all cohorts expressed the importance of the drug's availability as hugely or very important.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The survey responses highlight the activity of sirolimus for EHE and the importance of securing a label extension for the drug delivering equitable access to this treatment for patients.\n    \n\n\n          Keywords:\n        \n      \n      EHE; drug repurposing; epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; patient advocates; patient survey; sarcoma; sirolimus.\n    \n\n    Copyright © 2024 Robinson, Leonard, Baldi, Tap, Jones, Stacchiotti and Pantziarka.\n  \n\nPubMed Disclaimer\n\n\n      Conflict of interest statement\n    \nGB: Consulting fees from Eli Lilly, PharmaMar, AboutEvents; Honoraria from Pharmamar, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharp & Dome, Eisai, Istituto Gentili; Support for attending meetings and/or travels from Novartis, Pharmamar, Eli Lilly; Participation on the advisory board from PharmaMar, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharp & Dome, Eisai.

Medical treatment is limited and has conflicting results. Off-label use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors shows promising results. The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the literature published about the efficacy and safety of sirolimus in the treatment of vascular anomalies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review of the published literature was conducted using the PubMed database and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 73 articles included: 2 randomized controlled studies, 2 nonrandomized prospective studies, and 69 retrospective case reports and case series. In total, 373 patients were included. Sirolimus was administered topically to 56 patients and orally to 317 patients. Sirolimus was highly effective in the treatment of vascular tumors associated with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (95.5% of the patients clinically improved and 93% had normalization of coagulopathy), venous malformations (size reduction was observed in 88.9% of patients), and lymphatic malformations (clinical improvement in 94.9% of patients).

However, the long-term management remains challenging.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The SIROLO study assessed the long-term effects and real-life management of oral sirolimus for SFVMs by investigating data from 15 French tertiary centres for vascular anomalies.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants were retrospectively included if they had a SFVM that was being/had been treated with sirolimus for at least 3 years in total. Data were collected on treatment goals when initiating sirolimus, investigator-reported efficacy, safety, dosages and treatment withdrawal.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The cohort involved 67 patients with various SFVM entities (mean [±SD] age 19.6 ± 12.5 years, 35 children, 52.2%). We found a heterogeneity of predefined treatment goals, the most frequent being cessation of pain. The investigators considered that sirolimus had persistent efficacy for bleeding, ulceration and pain but only slight efficacy for reducing volume. It was reported to be well-tolerated, although serious adverse events (mainly infections and also two ovarian cysts) were reported in 6 patients (9.0%) and required definitive sirolimus discontinuation for one. Overall, 11 patients (16.4%) had at least one temporary withdrawal period, leading to symptom recurrence and sirolimus resumption at a mean of 6.4 ± 9.6 months. The mean sirolimus concentration was 6.4 ± 3.7 ng/mL during the first 6 months and decreased over time (mean concentration during the last 6 months: 4.2 ± 3.2 ng/mL), probably to target the minimal efficient dosage. Eight patients (11.9%) switched to alpelisib because of insufficient efficacy of sirolimus.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This real-life study gives answers to frequent questions patients and parents ask before sirolimus initiation for SFVMs, such as persistence of efficacy over time, long-term side effects and time to recurrence in case of withdrawal.\n    \n\n    © 2024 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.\n  \n\nPubMed Disclaimer\n\n\n        Similar articles\n      \n\n      References\n    \n\n      Related information\n    \n\n      LinkOut - more resources\n    \nFull Text Sources\nNCBI Literature Resources\n\nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Extensive cases are treated with amputation as chemotherapy seems to be ineffective. Recently, promising results were published using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tumors of vascular origin. Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity. This case contributes to the growing evidence regarding the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, in multifocal PMH.\nKeywords: mTOR inhibition; pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; sirolimus.\n© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nEverolimus for Treatment of Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma.\nOzeki M, Nozawa A, Kanda K, Hori T, Nagano A, Shimada A, Miyazaki T, Fukao T.

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported case of PMH and the first successful and limb-sparing utilization of systemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma with bone and soft tissue involvement with favorable response to pamidronate: a case report and systematic review of the literature.\nBrance ML, Cóccaro NM, Roitman P, Castiglioni A, Agostinis F, Spense M, Scheitlin B, Rene N, Brun LR.

Medical treatment is limited and has conflicting results. Off-label use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors shows promising results. The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the literature published about the efficacy and safety of sirolimus in the treatment of vascular anomalies.\nMethods: A systematic review of the published literature was conducted using the PubMed database and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.\nResults: There were 73 articles included: 2 randomized controlled studies, 2 nonrandomized prospective studies, and 69 retrospective case reports and case series. In total, 373 patients were included. Sirolimus was administered topically to 56 patients and orally to 317 patients. Sirolimus was highly effective in the treatment of vascular tumors associated with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (95.5% of the patients clinically improved and 93% had normalization of coagulopathy), venous malformations (size reduction was observed in 88.9% of patients), and lymphatic malformations (clinical improvement in 94.9% of patients). Topical sirolimus results were conflicting. Arteriovenous malformations were not improved by sirolimus.\nConclusions: Low-level evidence suggests that sirolimus can improve the prognosis of vascular anomalies, most notably vascular tumors associated with life-threatening coagulopathy and venous and lymphatic malformations. Further research is needed to establish the benefits of sirolimus in the management of vascular anomalies.\nKeywords: Sirolimus; Vascular anomalies; Vascular malformations; Vascular tumors.\nCopyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Traditional therapies, such as surgery and embolization, may be insufficient or technically impossible for patients with KHE. Sirolimus (or rapamycin), a specific inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin, has recently been demonstrated to be very useful in the treatment of KHEs. Here, we highlight recent substantial progress regarding the effects of sirolimus on KHEs and discuss the potential mechanisms of action of sirolimus in treating this disease. The prevention of platelet activation and inflammation, along with antiangiogenic effects, the inhibition of lymphangiogenesis, the attenuation of fibrosis, or a combination of all these effects, may be responsible for the therapeutic effects of sirolimus. In addition, the mechanism of sirolimus resistance in some KHE patients is discussed. Finally, we review the somatic mutations that have recently been identified in KEH lesions, and discuss the potential of novel therapeutic targets based on these further understandings of the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of KHE.\nKeywords: drug resistance; kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas; mechanism; sirolimus; treatment.\n© 2024 UICC.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nErratum: Eyestalk Ablation to Increase Ovarian Maturation in Mud Crabs.\n[No authors listed] [No authors listed] J Vis Exp. 2023 May 26;(195). doi: 10.3791/6561.

Over 50% of patients present with metastatic disease, requiring systemic therapy, although no systemic therapies are specifically approved for EHE. Retrospective evidence supports the activity of mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus), although available only off-label. EHE patients and advocates are therefore working to support approval of effective treatments by collecting data on patient perspectives and experiences.\nMaterials and methods: In February 2023, the EHE Rare Cancer Charity (UK) and The EHE Foundation (US), with other advocates, conducted a survey of perspectives and experiences of EHE patients regarding the use and accessibility of sirolimus. The survey consisted of 20 questions designed for individuals undergoing treatment, those who had been treated, or had never been treated with the drug. Widely promoted within the patient community, the online survey categorized patients into three cohorts for the analysis: liver transplant patients, non-transplant patients who had ever taken sirolimus and sirolimus-naïve non-transplant patients.\nResults: The survey evaluated data from 129 patient responses from 21 countries, mostly from USA, UK, Australia, and Canada (70%). The liver transplant, sirolimus and non-sirolimus cohorts were 16%, 25% and 59%, respectively. In the sirolimus group 66% reported treatment durations exceeding one year, with 16% exceeding five years, indicating the drug's efficacy. In the non-sirolimus group, the drug was not available for 42% and for 11% sirolimus was available but not selected for treatment because of its off-label status. Overall, 87% of all patients across all cohorts expressed the importance of the drug's availability as hugely or very important.\nConclusion: The survey responses highlight the activity of sirolimus for EHE and the importance of securing a label extension for the drug delivering equitable access to this treatment for patients.\nKeywords: EHE; drug repurposing; epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; patient advocates; patient survey; sarcoma; sirolimus.\nCopyright © 2024 Robinson, Leonard, Baldi, Tap, Jones, Stacchiotti and Pantziarka.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nConflict of interest statement\nGB: Consulting fees from Eli Lilly, PharmaMar, AboutEvents; Honoraria from Pharmamar, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharp & Dome, Eisai, Istituto Gentili; Support for attending meetings and/or travels from Novartis, Pharmamar, Eli Lilly; Participation on the advisory board from PharmaMar, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharp & Dome, Eisai.

Disease progression in the 6 months before the start of treatment was required. Each pathologic diagnosis was reviewed. The daily dose of sirolimus was adjusted based on plasma levels. Response was retrospectively assessed by local investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST). Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nResults: All 38 patients (WW Domain Containing Transcription Regulator 1 [WWTR1]-positive, n = 37; transcription factor E3 [TFE3]-positive, n = 1) had disease progression before starting sirolimus (at baseline, 13 of 38 patients had the presence of serosal effusions and systemic symptoms). Thirty-seven patients were evaluable for response (there was 1 early interruption). The best RECIST responses were a partial response in 4 patients (10.8%), stable disease in 28 patients (75.7%), and disease progression in 5 patients (13.5%). At a 41.5-month median follow-up (interquartile range [IQR], 23.9-56.8 months), the median PFS was 13 months (95% CI, 3.7 months to not estimated [NE]), and the median OS was 18.8 months (95% CI, 10.6 months to NE). In patients who had serosal effusions at baseline, the median PFS was 4.8 months (IQR, 3.5-11.7 months), and the median OS was 10.6 months (IQR, 5.1-13.0 months), compared with 47.8 months (IQR, 11.4 months to NE) and 47.8 months (IQR, 15.7 months to NE), respectively, in patients without serosal effusions. Overall, sirolimus was fairly well tolerated, with 10 patients reporting irregular menstruation/ovary disfunction.\nConclusions: The current results confirm that sirolimus is active in EHE, leading to prolonged stabilization in most patients who present without serosal effusions.

Pathologic review and molecular analysis for WWTR1 rearrangement were performed. Sirolimus was administered until unacceptable toxicity or progression, with the dose being adjusted to reach target plasma levels of 15-20 ng/dL. Responses were assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\nResults: Since 2005, 18 patients (17 EHE, 1 retiform HE; 1 locally advanced, 17 metastatic; WWTR1 rearrangement: 16) have been identified, with 17/18 patients being evaluable for response. Mean sirolimus daily dose was 4.5 mg. According to RECIST, best responses in EHE were 1 partial response (PR), 12 stable disease (SD), and 3 progressive disease (PD); the patient with retiform HE also achieved a PR, lasting >2 years. Four patients with a reversed interval progression on interruption were observed. Median overall survival was 16 months, and median progression-free survival was 12 months (range 1-45), with four patients progression-free at 24 months. The clinical benefit (complete response [CR] + PR + SD >6 months) was 56 %. Seven patients receiving sirolimus experienced an increase in pleural/peritoneal effusion plus worsening of tumor-related symptoms; six of these patients died within 1-8 months from evidence of effusion progression, while a RECIST PD was assessed in two of seven patients.\nConclusions: A clinical benefit was achieved in 56 % of patients receiving sirolimus, which lasted >24 months in four patients. Most patients with pleural effusion did not benefit from sirolimus and had a poor outcome.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nActivity of sirolimus in patients with progressive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: A case-series analysis within the Italian Rare Cancer Network.\nStacchiotti S, Simeone N, Lo Vullo S, Baldi GG, Brunello A, Vincenzi B, Palassini E, Dagrada G, Collini P, Morosi C, Greco FG, Sbaraglia M, Dei Tos AP, Mariani L, Frezza AM, Casali PG.

Here, we describe severe adverse events (SAEs) observed during \"off-label use\" for vascular anomalies.\nMethods: We performed a retrospective, multicenter chart review for SAEs during \"off-label\" sirolimus therapy for vascular anomalies and analyzed these cases by a predesigned workflow.\nResults: We identified 17 SAEs in 14 patients diagnosed with generalized lymphatic anomaly (n = 4), Gorham-Stout disease (n = 2), central conducting lymphatic anomaly (n = 1), lymphatic malformation (n = 4), tufted angioma (n = 1), kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (n = 1), and venous malformation in a patient with CLOVES syndrome (n = 1). Three patients presented two SAEs each. The age at initiation of sirolimus therapy was under 2 years (n = 5), 2-6 years (n = 5), and older than 12 years (n = 4). SAEs occurred during the first 3 months of sirolimus therapy (n = 7), between 3 and 12 months (n = 7) and after 1 year of therapy (n = 3). The most frequent SAE was viral pneumonia (n = 8) resulting in one death due to a metapneumovirus infection in a 3 months old and a generalized adenovirus infection in a 28-month-old child. Sirolimus blood level at the time of SAEs ranged between 2.7 and 21 ng/L. Five patients were on antibiotic prophylaxis.\nConclusions: Most SAEs are observed in the first year of sirolimus therapy; however, SAEs can also occur after a longer treatment period. SAEs are potentially life threatening, especially in early infancy. Presence of other risk factors, that is, underlying vascular anomaly or immune status, may contribute to the risk of SAEs. Sirolimus is an important therapeutic option for vascular anomalies, but patients and physicians need to be aware that adequate monitoring is necessary, especially in patients with complex lymphatic anomalies that are overrepresented in our cohort of SAEs.\nKeywords: severe adverse events; sirolimus; toxicity; vascular anomalies.\n© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nSirolimus in the Treatment of Vascular Anomalies.\nTriana P, Dore M, Cerezo VN, Cervantes M, Sánchez AV, Ferrero MM, González MD, Lopez-Gutierrez JC.

Extensive cases are treated with amputation as chemotherapy seems to be ineffective. Recently, promising results were published using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tumors of vascular origin. Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity. This case contributes to the growing evidence regarding the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, in multifocal PMH.\nKeywords: mTOR inhibition; pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; sirolimus.\n© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nEverolimus for Treatment of Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma.\nOzeki M, Nozawa A, Kanda K, Hori T, Nagano A, Shimada A, Miyazaki T, Fukao T.

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported case of PMH and the first successful and limb-sparing utilization of systemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma with bone and soft tissue involvement with favorable response to pamidronate: a case report and systematic review of the literature.\nBrance ML, Cóccaro NM, Roitman P, Castiglioni A, Agostinis F, Spense M, Scheitlin B, Rene N, Brun LR.

It is a rarely metastasizing, low-grade vascular tumor that can histologically mimic epithelioid sarcoma and often presents as multiple discontinuous nodules in the extremities. PHEs characteristically and consistently show immunoreactivity for cytokeratins and endothelial markers. We present a case in the thigh of a 65-year-old-man with a 3-month history of painful lesions in the dermis and review the published literature. In our case, the lesion exhibited the characteristic histologic findings and immunoprofile of a PHE: a solid proliferation of spindled to epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and frequent rhabdoid cells. Cytologic atypia and mitotic figures were inconspicuous. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD31, ERG, AE1/3, and CK7 and negative for D2-40, P53, HMB45, desmin, CD34, SMA, EMA, and S100 protein. A balanced reciprocal translation between chromosomes 7 and 19 was present; this translocation seems unique to PHE. PHE is a unique and commonly misdiagnosed entity; therefore, we review the literature to describe the characteristics of this tumor.\n    \n\nPubMed Disclaimer\n\n\n        Similar articles\n      \n\n        Cited by\n      \n\n        Publication types\n      \n\n        MeSH terms\n      \n\n        Substances\n      \n\n      Related information\n    \n\n      LinkOut - more resources\n    \nFull Text Sources\nOther Literature Sources\nResearch Materials\nMiscellaneous\nNCBI Literature Resources\n\nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, sirolimus, has been used successfully in adult EHE and other vascular tumors in children but has not been studied in pediatric EHE. The aim of this retrospective case series is to discuss the results of sirolimus for treatment in 6 pediatric patients with EHE. Four of 6 patients demonstrated partial response or disease stabilization with sirolimus treatment. No treatment dosing, trough goals, or duration of treatment recommendations can be made. Prospective studies are warranted to further investigate the use of sirolimus in treatment of EHE.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nSirolimus in Advanced Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma: A Retrospective Case-Series Analysis from the Italian Rare Cancer Network Database.\nStacchiotti S, Provenzano S, Dagrada G, Negri T, Brich S, Basso U, Brunello A, Grosso F, Galli L, Palassini E, Libertini M, Colia V, Gronchi A, Dei Tos AP, Crippa F, Morosi C, Pilotti S, Casali PG.

The pancreas is not a common site of KHE, especially in pediatric patients. Given that no guidelines are available for the treatment of KHE, management is currently based on expert opinions and clinical experiences. Here, we report a case of pancreatic KHE with obstructive jaundice, which was treated successfully with oral sirolimus instead of radical surgery. Additionally, a literature review on pancreatic KHE was performed to summarize prior clinical experiences and the available treatments.\n    \n\n\n          Case description:\n        \n      \n      A 10-month-old Chinese male infant presented with obstructive jaundice without any signs of fever, abdominal pain, or distention. A detailed consultation revealed an uneventful history. The obstructive jaundice worsened significantly during 3 weeks of conservative therapy. A pancreatic mass was identified via radiological evidence, and a laparoscopic biopsy of the tumor was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic KHE based on histological findings. Oral sirolimus 0.8 mg/m2 twice daily was administered at a steady serum concentration of 5-15 ng/mL, which led to a shrinkage in tumor size and resolution of jaundice. The patient showed no evidence of recurrence after 1 year of follow-up and is still on sirolimus treatment, which has been tolerated well up to the time of this report.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The pancreas is a rare location of KHE, which is a locally aggressive vascular tumor.

Disease progression in the 6 months before the start of treatment was required. Each pathologic diagnosis was reviewed. The daily dose of sirolimus was adjusted based on plasma levels. Response was retrospectively assessed by local investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST). Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nResults: All 38 patients (WW Domain Containing Transcription Regulator 1 [WWTR1]-positive, n = 37; transcription factor E3 [TFE3]-positive, n = 1) had disease progression before starting sirolimus (at baseline, 13 of 38 patients had the presence of serosal effusions and systemic symptoms). Thirty-seven patients were evaluable for response (there was 1 early interruption). The best RECIST responses were a partial response in 4 patients (10.8%), stable disease in 28 patients (75.7%), and disease progression in 5 patients (13.5%). At a 41.5-month median follow-up (interquartile range [IQR], 23.9-56.8 months), the median PFS was 13 months (95% CI, 3.7 months to not estimated [NE]), and the median OS was 18.8 months (95% CI, 10.6 months to NE). In patients who had serosal effusions at baseline, the median PFS was 4.8 months (IQR, 3.5-11.7 months), and the median OS was 10.6 months (IQR, 5.1-13.0 months), compared with 47.8 months (IQR, 11.4 months to NE) and 47.8 months (IQR, 15.7 months to NE), respectively, in patients without serosal effusions. Overall, sirolimus was fairly well tolerated, with 10 patients reporting irregular menstruation/ovary disfunction.\nConclusions: The current results confirm that sirolimus is active in EHE, leading to prolonged stabilization in most patients who present without serosal effusions. Serosal effusions are confirmed as an unfavorable prognostic sign associated with short survival, and sirolimus displays limited activity in this subgroup.\nKeywords: chemotherapy; epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; metastasis; prognosis; sarcoma; serosal effusion; sirolimus.\n© 2020 American Cancer Society.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nComment in\n\n\nSirolimus for patients with progressive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\nSmrke AM, Huang PH, Jones RL.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus for the treatment of progressive KHE. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with progressive KHE treated with sirolimus. A total of 52 patients were analyzed. Thirty-seven (71%) patients exhibited Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) and were significantly younger than the patients without KMP [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.39-41.61; p < 0.001]. Patients without KMP were all treated with sirolimus alone, whereas 21 KMP patients with severe symptoms received short-term combination therapy with prednisolone. Overall, 96% and 98% of patients showed improved relief of notable symptoms and/or improved complications at 6 and 12 months after treatment, respectively. After sirolimus treatment, significant decreases in mean severity scores occurred at 6 months (95% CI, 2.23-2.54, p < 0.001) and 12 months (95% CI, 1.53-1.90, p < 0.001). Compared to KMP patients, patients without KMP showed a response that was similar to but less pronounced during the 12 months of treatment (95% CI, 40.87-53.80; p < 0.001). For subgroup analysis of KMP patients, there were no significant differences in tumor shrinkage between those treated with combination therapy and those receiving sirolimus alone (95% CI, 18.11-25.02; p > 0.05). No patients permanently discontinued treatment due to toxicity-related events, and no drug-related deaths occurred. Sirolimus was effective and safe for the treatment of progressive KHE. Sirolimus may be considered as a first-line therapy or as part of a multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of KHE.\n    \n\n\n          Keywords:\n        \n      \n      Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon; efficacy; kaposiform hemangioendothelioma; safety; sirolimus.\n    \n\n    © 2017 UICC.\n  \n\nPubMed Disclaimer\n\n\n        Similar articles\n      \n\n        Cited by\n      \n\n        Publication types\n      \n\n        MeSH terms\n      \n\n        Substances\n      \n\n        Supplementary concepts\n      \n\n      Related information\n    \n\n      LinkOut - more resources\n    \nFull Text Sources\nOther Literature Sources\nMedical\nNCBI Literature Resources\n\nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of the disease have emerged as potential refinements. Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer is daunting in the breadth and scope of its diversity, spanning genetics, cell and tissue biology, pathology, and response to therapy. Ever more powerful experimental and computational tools and technologies are providing an avalanche of \"big data\" about the myriad manifestations of the diseases that cancer encompasses. The integrative concept embodied in the hallmarks of cancer is helping to distill this complexity into an increasingly logical science, and the provisional new dimensions presented in this perspective may add value to that endeavor, to more fully understand mechanisms of cancer development and malignant progression, and apply that knowledge to cancer medicine.\n    \n\n    ©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.\n  \n\nPubMed Disclaimer\n\n\n        Similar articles\n      \n\n        Cited by\n      \n\n      References\n    \n\n        Publication types\n      \n\n        MeSH terms\n      \n\n      Related information\n    \n\n      LinkOut - more resources\n    \nFull Text Sources\nOther Literature Sources\nResearch Materials\nNCBI Literature Resources\n\nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported case of PMH and the first successful and limb-sparing utilization of systemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma with bone and soft tissue involvement with favorable response to pamidronate: a case report and systematic review of the literature.\nBrance ML, Cóccaro NM, Roitman P, Castiglioni A, Agostinis F, Spense M, Scheitlin B, Rene N, Brun LR.

Extensive cases are treated with amputation as chemotherapy seems to be ineffective. Recently, promising results were published using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tumors of vascular origin. Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity.

It is a rarely metastasizing, low-grade vascular tumor that can histologically mimic epithelioid sarcoma and often presents as multiple discontinuous nodules in the extremities. PHEs characteristically and consistently show immunoreactivity for cytokeratins and endothelial markers. We present a case in the thigh of a 65-year-old-man with a 3-month history of painful lesions in the dermis and review the published literature. In our case, the lesion exhibited the characteristic histologic findings and immunoprofile of a PHE: a solid proliferation of spindled to epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and frequent rhabdoid cells. Cytologic atypia and mitotic figures were inconspicuous. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD31, ERG, AE1/3, and CK7 and negative for D2-40, P53, HMB45, desmin, CD34, SMA, EMA, and S100 protein. A balanced reciprocal translation between chromosomes 7 and 19 was present; this translocation seems unique to PHE. PHE is a unique and commonly misdiagnosed entity; therefore, we review the literature to describe the characteristics of this tumor.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nA rare case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE)/epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma (ES-H) of the breast first misdiagnosed as metaplastic carcinoma by FNAB and review of the literature.\nGe Y, Lin X, Zhang F, Xu F, Luo L, Huang W, Liu Z, Liu Y, Li Z.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus for the treatment of progressive KHE. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with progressive KHE treated with sirolimus. A total of 52 patients were analyzed. Thirty-seven (71%) patients exhibited Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) and were significantly younger than the patients without KMP [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.39-41.61; p < 0.001]. Patients without KMP were all treated with sirolimus alone, whereas 21 KMP patients with severe symptoms received short-term combination therapy with prednisolone. Overall, 96% and 98% of patients showed improved relief of notable symptoms and/or improved complications at 6 and 12 months after treatment, respectively. After sirolimus treatment, significant decreases in mean severity scores occurred at 6 months (95% CI, 2.23-2.54, p < 0.001) and 12 months (95% CI, 1.53-1.90, p < 0.001). Compared to KMP patients, patients without KMP showed a response that was similar to but less pronounced during the 12 months of treatment (95% CI, 40.87-53.80; p < 0.001). For subgroup analysis of KMP patients, there were no significant differences in tumor shrinkage between those treated with combination therapy and those receiving sirolimus alone (95% CI, 18.11-25.02; p > 0.05). No patients permanently discontinued treatment due to toxicity-related events, and no drug-related deaths occurred. Sirolimus was effective and safe for the treatment of progressive KHE. Sirolimus may be considered as a first-line therapy or as part of a multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of KHE.\nKeywords: Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon; efficacy; kaposiform hemangioendothelioma; safety; sirolimus.\n© 2017 UICC.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nKaposiform hemangioendothelioma with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon in an infant: Successful treatment with prednisolone, vincristine, and addition of sirolimus.\nCashell J, Smink GM, Helm K, Xavier F.

The pancreas is not a common site of KHE, especially in pediatric patients. Given that no guidelines are available for the treatment of KHE, management is currently based on expert opinions and clinical experiences. Here, we report a case of pancreatic KHE with obstructive jaundice, which was treated successfully with oral sirolimus instead of radical surgery. Additionally, a literature review on pancreatic KHE was performed to summarize prior clinical experiences and the available treatments.\nCase description: A 10-month-old Chinese male infant presented with obstructive jaundice without any signs of fever, abdominal pain, or distention. A detailed consultation revealed an uneventful history. The obstructive jaundice worsened significantly during 3 weeks of conservative therapy. A pancreatic mass was identified via radiological evidence, and a laparoscopic biopsy of the tumor was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic KHE based on histological findings. Oral sirolimus 0.8 mg/m2 twice daily was administered at a steady serum concentration of 5-15 ng/mL, which led to a shrinkage in tumor size and resolution of jaundice. The patient showed no evidence of recurrence after 1 year of follow-up and is still on sirolimus treatment, which has been tolerated well up to the time of this report.\nConclusions: The pancreas is a rare location of KHE, which is a locally aggressive vascular tumor. Diagnosis is based on histological findings, and therapy should be multidisciplinary and individualized. Although sirolimus has been very successful in the treatment of KHE even without radical surgery, the possible risks of tumor recurrence and adverse effects warrant some caution.\nKeywords: Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE); case report; child; pancreas; sirolimus.\n2022 Translational Pediatrics.

Traditional therapies, such as surgery and embolization, may be insufficient or technically impossible for patients with KHE. Sirolimus (or rapamycin), a specific inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin, has recently been demonstrated to be very useful in the treatment of KHEs. Here, we highlight recent substantial progress regarding the effects of sirolimus on KHEs and discuss the potential mechanisms of action of sirolimus in treating this disease. The prevention of platelet activation and inflammation, along with antiangiogenic effects, the inhibition of lymphangiogenesis, the attenuation of fibrosis, or a combination of all these effects, may be responsible for the therapeutic effects of sirolimus. In addition, the mechanism of sirolimus resistance in some KHE patients is discussed. Finally, we review the somatic mutations that have recently been identified in KEH lesions, and discuss the potential of novel therapeutic targets based on these further understandings of the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of KHE.\nKeywords: drug resistance; kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas; mechanism; sirolimus; treatment.\n© 2024 UICC.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nErratum: Eyestalk Ablation to Increase Ovarian Maturation in Mud Crabs.\n[No authors listed] [No authors listed] J Vis Exp. 2023 May 26;(195). doi: 10.3791/6561.

The purpose of this study was to present our experience involving sirolimus therapy for KHE. A retrospective study was conducted to review the medical documents of 26 patients with KHE who were treated with sirolimus at our hospital between March 2012 and December 2016. Fifteen males and 11 females manifested KHE in infancy with an average age of 2.9 ± 1.8 months. Multiple anatomical sites were involved. Four patients had multifocal lesions, while 22 patients had solitary lesions. Twenty-five patients had Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP). Twenty patients completed sirolimus therapy in 28.3 ± 12.5 months. Nineteen KHE lesions reduced to small residuals with platelet counts reaching normal levels 3.7 ± 2.8 weeks after treatment; one KHE lesion had no response to therapy. One patient with multifocal lesions died due to a severe infection, although the patient had previously responded to sirolimus. Five patients remained in treatment and had good responses with normal platelet counts. Nineteen patients with anemia had normal hemoglobin levels after 3.5 ± 1.9 weeks of treatment. Mild side effects were observed. The median follow-up time was 32 months (26-60 months), with no evidence of recurrences. Sirolimus was shown to be efficacious in the management of KHE with an average course of 28 months. The time-to-response was variable, with an average of 1 week. After 4 weeks of treatment, the platelet count and hemoglobin level had normalized. Multifocal KHE with KMP is more severe than solitary KHE.\n    \n\n\n          Keywords:\n        \n      \n      kaposiform hemangioendothelioma; long-term; multifocal; sirolimus; treatment.\n    \n\n    © 2019 Japanese Dermatological Association.\n  \n\nPubMed Disclaimer\n\n\n        Similar articles\n      \n\n        Cited by\n      \n\n      References\n    \n\n        MeSH terms\n      \n\n        Substances\n      \n\n        Supplementary concepts\n      \n\n      Related information\n    \n\n        Grants and funding\n      \n\n      LinkOut - more resources\n    \nFull Text Sources\nMedical\nNCBI Literature Resources\n\nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

However, the long-term management remains challenging.\nObjectives: The SIROLO study assessed the long-term effects and real-life management of oral sirolimus for SFVMs by investigating data from 15 French tertiary centres for vascular anomalies.\nMethods: Participants were retrospectively included if they had a SFVM that was being/had been treated with sirolimus for at least 3 years in total. Data were collected on treatment goals when initiating sirolimus, investigator-reported efficacy, safety, dosages and treatment withdrawal.\nResults: The cohort involved 67 patients with various SFVM entities (mean [±SD] age 19.6 ± 12.5 years, 35 children, 52.2%). We found a heterogeneity of predefined treatment goals, the most frequent being cessation of pain. The investigators considered that sirolimus had persistent efficacy for bleeding, ulceration and pain but only slight efficacy for reducing volume. It was reported to be well-tolerated, although serious adverse events (mainly infections and also two ovarian cysts) were reported in 6 patients (9.0%) and required definitive sirolimus discontinuation for one. Overall, 11 patients (16.4%) had at least one temporary withdrawal period, leading to symptom recurrence and sirolimus resumption at a mean of 6.4 ± 9.6 months. The mean sirolimus concentration was 6.4 ± 3.7 ng/mL during the first 6 months and decreased over time (mean concentration during the last 6 months: 4.2 ± 3.2 ng/mL), probably to target the minimal efficient dosage. Eight patients (11.9%) switched to alpelisib because of insufficient efficacy of sirolimus.\nConclusion: This real-life study gives answers to frequent questions patients and parents ask before sirolimus initiation for SFVMs, such as persistence of efficacy over time, long-term side effects and time to recurrence in case of withdrawal.\n© 2024 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nFalls prevention interventions for community-dwelling older adults: systematic review and meta-analysis of benefits, harms, and patient values and preferences.\nPillay J, Gaudet LA, Saba S, Vandermeer B, Ashiq AR, Wingert A, Hartling L.

Extensive cases are treated with amputation as chemotherapy seems to be ineffective. Recently, promising results were published using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tumors of vascular origin. Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity. This case contributes to the growing evidence regarding the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus, in multifocal PMH.\nKeywords: mTOR inhibition; pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma; sirolimus.\n© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nEverolimus for Treatment of Pseudomyogenic Hemangioendothelioma.\nOzeki M, Nozawa A, Kanda K, Hori T, Nagano A, Shimada A, Miyazaki T, Fukao T.

However, the efficacy, durability and tolerability of long-term sirolimus treatment in patients with KHE have not been well elucidated. We performed efficacy and safety assessments based on more than 4.5 years of follow-up in patients receiving sirolimus therapy for KHE. One hundred sixty-seven patients were analyzed, including 102 (61.1%) patients with the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP). Follow-up was conducted after a median of 56.0 months. A total of 154 (92.2%) patients had a durable response to sirolimus treatment. No difference in durable response was found between patients without KMP and patients with KMP (95.4% vs 90.2%; difference, 5.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.0% to 13.1%). Rebound growth occurred in 17.3% of patients upon sirolimus discontinuation. Early treatment discontinuation (odds ratio [OR]: 3.103; 95% CI: 1.529-6.299; P = .002) and mixed lesion type (OR: 2.271; 95% CI: 0.901-5.727; P = .047) were associated with tumor rebound growth. No KHE-related deaths occurred in this cohort. At the last follow-up, approximately 17.4% of patients had active disease and/or changes in body structures to a variable extent. Serious adverse events occurred most commonly during the first year of sirolimus therapy. Follow-up of almost 4.5 years demonstrated that the efficacy of sirolimus persisted over time and that long-term treatment with sirolimus was not associated with unacceptable cumulative toxicities. However, nonresponse, tumor relapse and long-term sequelae remained challenges despite intensified and prolonged sirolimus therapy.\nKeywords: Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon; kaposiform hemangioendothelioma; long-term; sirolimus; treatment.\n© 2023 UICC.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nSirolimus for the treatment of progressive kaposiform hemangioendothelioma: A multicenter retrospective study.\nJi Y, Chen S, Xiang B, Li K, Xu Z, Yao W, Lu G, Liu X, Xia C, Wang Q, Li Y, Wang C, Yang K, Yang G, Tang X, Xu T, Wu H.

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide margins. Evidence-based treatment options are lacking, and lack of clear prognostic features poses a risk of undertreatment or overtreatment with associated morbidity and mortality. We report the use of initial systemic therapy with oral sirolimus (SIR) and IV zoledronic acid (ZA) to induce a sustained clinical response and avoidance of amputation in a 6-year-old boy. At 37 months after diagnosis, our patient remains in sustained clinical remission as documented by x-ray, MRI, and PET-CT with return of normal mobility/activity and resolution of swelling and pain. Literature review identified 20 cases of pediatric and young adult patients with PMH, of which 7 received some form of systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents the youngest reported case of PMH and the first successful and limb-sparing utilization of systemic chemotherapy as primary treatment for PMH.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma with bone and soft tissue involvement with favorable response to pamidronate: a case report and systematic review of the literature.\nBrance ML, Cóccaro NM, Roitman P, Castiglioni A, Agostinis F, Spense M, Scheitlin B, Rene N, Brun LR.

It is locally aggressive and potentially life threatening when associated with consumptive coagulopathy, known as Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (KMS). No consensus or guideline for the therapy has been reached because of the lack of prospective trials, and the different standard care suggestions are based on retrospective case series.\nCase report: We report the case of a 9-month-old male with KHE and KMS in which the initial response, obtained with prednisone and vincristine, was subsequently consolidated and strengthened by long-term treatment with sirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor. A summary of the published data is presented as well.\nConclusions: The inhibition of mTOR pathway represents the most important therapeutic innovation introduced in the last few years for KHE. Our case shows the effectiveness and good tolerance of long-term therapy with sirolimus.\nKeywords: Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma; Kasabach-Merrit syndrome; Prednisone; Sirolimus; Vincristine.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nConflict of interest statement\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nFigures\n \n**Figure 1\n**\nAbdominal MRI performed at 1,…\n**Figure 1\n**\nAbdominal MRI performed at 1, 9, 16 months.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus for the treatment of progressive KHE. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with progressive KHE treated with sirolimus. A total of 52 patients were analyzed. Thirty-seven (71%) patients exhibited Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) and were significantly younger than the patients without KMP [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.39-41.61; p < 0.001]. Patients without KMP were all treated with sirolimus alone, whereas 21 KMP patients with severe symptoms received short-term combination therapy with prednisolone. Overall, 96% and 98% of patients showed improved relief of notable symptoms and/or improved complications at 6 and 12 months after treatment, respectively. After sirolimus treatment, significant decreases in mean severity scores occurred at 6 months (95% CI, 2.23-2.54, p < 0.001) and 12 months (95% CI, 1.53-1.90, p < 0.001). Compared to KMP patients, patients without KMP showed a response that was similar to but less pronounced during the 12 months of treatment (95% CI, 40.87-53.80; p < 0.001). For subgroup analysis of KMP patients, there were no significant differences in tumor shrinkage between those treated with combination therapy and those receiving sirolimus alone (95% CI, 18.11-25.02; p > 0.05). No patients permanently discontinued treatment due to toxicity-related events, and no drug-related deaths occurred. Sirolimus was effective and safe for the treatment of progressive KHE. Sirolimus may be considered as a first-line therapy or as part of a multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of KHE.\nKeywords: Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon; efficacy; kaposiform hemangioendothelioma; safety; sirolimus.\n© 2017 UICC.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nKaposiform hemangioendothelioma with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon in an infant: Successful treatment with prednisolone, vincristine, and addition of sirolimus.\nCashell J, Smink GM, Helm K, Xavier F.

The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, sirolimus, has been used successfully in adult EHE and other vascular tumors in children but has not been studied in pediatric EHE. The aim of this retrospective case series is to discuss the results of sirolimus for treatment in 6 pediatric patients with EHE. Four of 6 patients demonstrated partial response or disease stabilization with sirolimus treatment. No treatment dosing, trough goals, or duration of treatment recommendations can be made. Prospective studies are warranted to further investigate the use of sirolimus in treatment of EHE.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nSimilar articles\n\n\nSirolimus in Advanced Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma: A Retrospective Case-Series Analysis from the Italian Rare Cancer Network Database.\nStacchiotti S, Provenzano S, Dagrada G, Negri T, Brich S, Basso U, Brunello A, Grosso F, Galli L, Palassini E, Libertini M, Colia V, Gronchi A, Dei Tos AP, Crippa F, Morosi C, Pilotti S, Casali PG.

Disease progression in the 6 months before the start of treatment was required. Each pathologic diagnosis was reviewed. The daily dose of sirolimus was adjusted based on plasma levels. Response was retrospectively assessed by local investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST). Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nResults: All 38 patients (WW Domain Containing Transcription Regulator 1 [WWTR1]-positive, n = 37; transcription factor E3 [TFE3]-positive, n = 1) had disease progression before starting sirolimus (at baseline, 13 of 38 patients had the presence of serosal effusions and systemic symptoms). Thirty-seven patients were evaluable for response (there was 1 early interruption). The best RECIST responses were a partial response in 4 patients (10.8%), stable disease in 28 patients (75.7%), and disease progression in 5 patients (13.5%). At a 41.5-month median follow-up (interquartile range [IQR], 23.9-56.8 months), the median PFS was 13 months (95% CI, 3.7 months to not estimated [NE]), and the median OS was 18.8 months (95% CI, 10.6 months to NE). In patients who had serosal effusions at baseline, the median PFS was 4.8 months (IQR, 3.5-11.7 months), and the median OS was 10.6 months (IQR, 5.1-13.0 months), compared with 47.8 months (IQR, 11.4 months to NE) and 47.8 months (IQR, 15.7 months to NE), respectively, in patients without serosal effusions. Overall, sirolimus was fairly well tolerated, with 10 patients reporting irregular menstruation/ovary disfunction.\nConclusions: The current results confirm that sirolimus is active in EHE, leading to prolonged stabilization in most patients who present without serosal effusions. Serosal effusions are confirmed as an unfavorable prognostic sign associated with short survival, and sirolimus displays limited activity in this subgroup.\nKeywords: chemotherapy; epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; metastasis; prognosis; sarcoma; serosal effusion; sirolimus.\n© 2020 American Cancer Society.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nComment in\n\n\nSirolimus for patients with progressive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\nSmrke AM, Huang PH, Jones RL.

Over 50% of patients present with metastatic disease, requiring systemic therapy, although no systemic therapies are specifically approved for EHE. Retrospective evidence supports the activity of mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus), although available only off-label. EHE patients and advocates are therefore working to support approval of effective treatments by collecting data on patient perspectives and experiences.\nMaterials and methods: In February 2023, the EHE Rare Cancer Charity (UK) and The EHE Foundation (US), with other advocates, conducted a survey of perspectives and experiences of EHE patients regarding the use and accessibility of sirolimus. The survey consisted of 20 questions designed for individuals undergoing treatment, those who had been treated, or had never been treated with the drug. Widely promoted within the patient community, the online survey categorized patients into three cohorts for the analysis: liver transplant patients, non-transplant patients who had ever taken sirolimus and sirolimus-naïve non-transplant patients.\nResults: The survey evaluated data from 129 patient responses from 21 countries, mostly from USA, UK, Australia, and Canada (70%). The liver transplant, sirolimus and non-sirolimus cohorts were 16%, 25% and 59%, respectively. In the sirolimus group 66% reported treatment durations exceeding one year, with 16% exceeding five years, indicating the drug's efficacy. In the non-sirolimus group, the drug was not available for 42% and for 11% sirolimus was available but not selected for treatment because of its off-label status. Overall, 87% of all patients across all cohorts expressed the importance of the drug's availability as hugely or very important.\nConclusion: The survey responses highlight the activity of sirolimus for EHE and the importance of securing a label extension for the drug delivering equitable access to this treatment for patients.\nKeywords: EHE; drug repurposing; epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; patient advocates; patient survey; sarcoma; sirolimus.\nCopyright © 2024 Robinson, Leonard, Baldi, Tap, Jones, Stacchiotti and Pantziarka.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nConflict of interest statement\nGB: Consulting fees from Eli Lilly, PharmaMar, AboutEvents; Honoraria from Pharmamar, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharp & Dome, Eisai, Istituto Gentili; Support for attending meetings and/or travels from Novartis, Pharmamar, Eli Lilly; Participation on the advisory board from PharmaMar, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharp & Dome, Eisai.

Pathologic review and molecular analysis for WWTR1 rearrangement were performed. Sirolimus was administered until unacceptable toxicity or progression, with the dose being adjusted to reach target plasma levels of 15-20 ng/dL. Responses were assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\nResults: Since 2005, 18 patients (17 EHE, 1 retiform HE; 1 locally advanced, 17 metastatic; WWTR1 rearrangement: 16) have been identified, with 17/18 patients being evaluable for response. Mean sirolimus daily dose was 4.5 mg. According to RECIST, best responses in EHE were 1 partial response (PR), 12 stable disease (SD), and 3 progressive disease (PD); the patient with retiform HE also achieved a PR, lasting >2 years. Four patients with a reversed interval progression on interruption were observed. Median overall survival was 16 months, and median progression-free survival was 12 months (range 1-45), with four patients progression-free at 24 months. The clinical benefit (complete response [CR] + PR + SD >6 months) was 56 %. Seven patients receiving sirolimus experienced an increase in pleural/peritoneal effusion plus worsening of tumor-related symptoms; six of these patients died within 1-8 months from evidence of effusion progression, while a RECIST PD was assessed in two of seven patients.\nConclusions: A clinical benefit was achieved in 56 % of patients receiving sirolimus, which lasted >24 months in four patients.

Here, we present a case of a child with advanced PMH relapsing after surgery and chemotherapy. Sirolimus achieved significant clinical improvement and stabilization of the lesions without any remarkable toxicity.

      "raw": "Abstract \n Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH), also known as epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, is a rare epithelioid vascular neoplasm predominantly affecting young adult males at an average age of approximately 30 years. This tumor is rare; therefore, detailed information regarding this tumor is still lacking. \n Here, we report a case of a man in his 20s presenting with left foot pain for about one year. Imaging showed a 2-cm ovoid, cortically based lesion with a lytic defect of the cortex at the fifth metatarsal proximal shaft. Histologically, the lesion presented as an infiltrating proliferation of distinctly myoid-appearing spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and mildly atypical vesicular nuclei. Scant mitoses were identified with no areas of necrosis. Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin expression as well as CD31 and ERG. CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells, and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present. \n Over half of the patients with PMH develop multifocal lesions, often involving several tissue planes; however, distant metastasis is very infrequent. This patient underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the prognosis of these lesions. \n Keywords: solitary lesion, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, indolent, vascular, sarcoma, epithelioid, hemangioendothelioma Introduction \n Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is an endothelial neoplasm, mostly indolent and with low-grade malignancy, having several different classifications. The current nomenclature was originally described by Hornick and Fletcher (2011), in which its myoid and epithelioid-like histologic pattern is defined as \"pseudomyogenic\" [ 1 ]. It is predominantly found in young adult males, at approximately 30 years of age, and in the distal extremities [ 1 ]. This vascular neoplasm is multifocal and can involve the dermis, subcutis, and bone [ 2 ]. The multifocality of these tumors tends to involve the same local anatomical regions as the original tumor [ 3 ]. This tumor is rare; therefore, investigation for additional detailed information regarding this tumor is warranted. Case presentation \n A male in his 20s presented with increasing pain in his left foot for the past year. He had a history of hypertension but had no other medical problems or trauma. A physical exam revealed tenderness over the fifth metatarsal, particularly at the proximal shaft. There was no warmth, erythema, or lymphadenopathy, and a reassuring distal neurovascular exam. Plain X-rays revealed a 2-cm ovoid lytic lesion in the fifth metatarsal, with a saucer-like deformity and significant scalloping, favoring reparative granuloma, chondroma, periosteal desmoid, or other neoplasms (Figure 1 ). The lesion was also identified on CT and MRI. A biopsy of the lesion was taken at the time of surgery. \n Figure 1.

Histopathological examination of the biopsied specimen revealed infiltrating proliferation of distinctly myoid-appearing spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and mildly atypical vesicular nuclei (Figure 2 ). \n Figure 2.

Tumor cells exhibited strong, diffuse cytokeratin AE1&amp;3 expression, as well as CD31 and ERG (Figure 3 ). CD34 was positive in a few tumor cells (Figure 3 ), and integrase interactor 1 (INI1) retained nuclear expression. No reactivity for S100, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD1a was present. \n Figure 3.

(D) Diffusely positive ERG stain (400x magnification). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel with 58 gene fusions (Cleveland Clinic Foundation panel) was performed and no gene fusion was detected. These findings are consistent with an epithelioid sarcoma-like epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), with a differential diagnosis including epithelioid vascular neoplasm and epithelioid sarcoma. The retention of INI1 expression, strong CD31 positivity, and lack of diffuse CD34 argue against epithelioid sarcoma, which was described as PMH. \n The decision was made to treat the lesion with debridement, curettage, grafting, and internal fixation. Post-surgical follow-up positron emission tomography (PET) scans were negative, and CT scans have shown progressive healing of the pathologic fracture and the cavitating cortical lesion (Figure 4 ). There was no evidence of recurrent tumor, including local recurrence or local spread to other sites after seven years of follow-up. \n Figure 4.

PMH can be asymptomatic, but the most common symptom is pain in the region of the tumor [ 4 ]. It most commonly occurs in the dermis and subcutis tissue layer, yet approximately half of the cases have intramuscular lesions, and 20% are intraosseous [ 1 ]. Grossly, 70% of these lesions are multifocal, unlike in this case as a solitary lesion, and average in size between 1 and 2.5 cm [ 2 , 5 ]. It is a mostly indolent tumor with a low likelihood to metastasize, as also demonstrated in this case [ 1 ]. The main treatment for PMH is debridement; however, chemotherapy is also used. Targeted angiogenic drugs have been proposed, specifically as a treatment for vascular tumors. Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitor drug in which mTOR is prevented from activating protein synthesis and angiogenesis. Sirolimus (rapamycin) and derivatives have been predicted to be an effective and less toxic treatment compared to chemotherapy for PMH [ 2 ]. \n Histologic morphology of PMH consists of neoplastic cells that are enlarged, spindled, and with bright eosinophilic cytoplasm that can mimic rhabdomyoblasts. They contain mild nuclear atypia and infrequent mitotic activity [ 1 , 6 ]. \n PMH has an inclusive differential diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteoblastoma, and vascular tumors [ 4 ]. PMH has presenting similarities with epithelioid sarcomas, such as presenting in the skin and soft tissue in the distal extremities and having diffuse keratin positivity [ 1 ]. This case represents the importance of identifying and distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors with poorer prognoses. To differentiate between PMH and epithelioid sarcoma, as both have cytokeratin positivity, epithelioid sarcoma expresses MNF116 and AE1&amp;3 and has a loss of expression of INI1 (90%) and CD34 (50%) [ 3 , 7 ]. PMH is also negative for pan-cytokeratin, EMA, and CD34, in which 50% are positive in epithelioid sarcoma [ 1 , 3 , 7 ]. Histologically, PMH can mimic other skeletal muscle tumors; however, PMH lacks expression for actin, MyoD1, and desmin [ 1 , 6 , 8 ]. PMH usually shows reactivity with vascular markers, including CD31, FLI1, and ERG, as well as co-expresses vimentin and keratins such as AE1&amp;3, CK7, and CAM5.2 [ 6 ]. \n Another useful tool in the diagnosis of PMH is the use of FOSB immunohistochemistry. The FOSB expression for PMH is strongly positive [ 9 ]. The SERPINE1-FOSB gene fusion due to the chromosomal translocation t(7;19)(q22;q13) has been identified in several cases [ 6 , 10 ]. The WHO 2020 classification reported on recently identified genetic alterations in which PMH has SERPINE1-FOSB and ACTB-FOSB, which can be useful when distinguishing PMH from other vascular tumors [ 10 ]. The differential diagnosis for PMH can be broad, and the rarity emphasizes the importance of immunohistochemical stains and increases the possibility of being overlooked. Conclusions \n PMH is a rare neoplasm, particularly with the involvement of the bone. It is characterized as a multifocal, male-predominant tumor with predominantly spindled epithelioid morphology and positive keratin markers. We presented a patient who underwent curettage and internal fixation of the left fifth metatarsal and had no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis after seven years of follow-up. Our case contributes to the growing knowledge of PMH and sheds light on the importance of the identification of these lesions and their effects on treatment and prognosis.

Although systemic chemotherapy has been reported with variable success, generally accepted treatment is aggressive surgery with wide mar- gins.

Key Words: pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma, limb preservation, sirolimus, zoledronic acid ( J Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2019;00:000 – 000) P seudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is a rare neoplasm ﬁ rst characterized by Mirra and colleagues in 1992 in an analysis of 5 patients previously diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma. 1,2 PMH typically presents as slow-growing multifocal nodules of one or more tissue planes of the extrem- ities in young adults, with a st rong male predominance. 3,4 PMH has morphologic and immunohistoc hemical features associated with both vascular and sarcomatous tumors and has recently been associated with a novel t(7;9)(q22;q13) genotype producing a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion protein. 1 – 5 Accepted initial treat- ment is surgical or ablative. 2,3,5 Local recurrence and spread is common with associated morbi dity and rare mortality, but metastasis to lungs and transf ormation to a more aggressive Ewing Sarcoma-like neopl asm has been described. 1 – 3,5 Risk of progression and optimal manage ment remain uncertain in this uncommon tumor. 3,5,6 The uncertain prognosis and lack of well-studied alternative therapies for PMH posed a clinical dilemma, such as in our patient, a 6-year-old boy who presented with multiostotic PMH of the bones of the right leg with growth plate involvement. Previous case reports have included use of conventional chemo- therapy agents, such as doxorubici n, cisplatin, and vincristine, but with variable ef ﬁ cacy (Table 1). Research has identi ﬁ ed mTOR inhibition as a promising targ et in many sarcomas, including other perivascular hemangioendotheliomas, 18 and use of an mTOR (mechanistic target of rapam ycin) inhibitor (everolimus) has been reported in one PMH case. 16 Zoledronic acid (ZA), which inhibits osteoclast-media ted bone resorption, has demon- strated effectiveness in preclinical models of bone sarcoma and is used as adjunctive therapy for me tastasis prevention in other cancers. 19 – 21 We report on the effective use of another mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus (SIR) toge ther with ZA in our patient with potentially limb-sparing impli cations. We also performed a lit- erature review to identify and discuss previous reports of systemic therapy in this rare disease. CASE REPORT A 6-year-old boy presented to his pediatrician with right ankle pain at football practice and dif ﬁ culty keeping up with his peers. He was initially diagnosed with an ankle sprain and treated with rest, ice, and ibuprofen. However, his pain worsened over several weeks prompting plain ﬁ lm imaging that revealed a lytic expansile bone lesion of the distal ﬁ bular metaphysis along with patchy sclerosis of multiple bones of the foot and proximal and distal tibial and ﬁ bular metaphyses (Fig. 1). Our patient was referred to orthopedics, and biopsy was performed which was read as “ infection versus PMH ” ; second opinions, at our institution and elsewhere, however reached a consensus of multifocal multiosteotic PMH of the leg. Pathology showed “ in ﬁ ltrative clusters of large round to elongated cells with abundant homogenously staining dense eosinophilic cytoplasm suggestive of muscle differentiation with characteristic FLI-1, CD31, and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 staining. Nuclei were enlarged with irregular nuclear contours and coarse chromatin. “ Vascular channel formation ” and “ intracytoplasmic lumina ” were not seen. Unfortunately, pathology slides from this outside study could not be obtained. Repeat biopsy done several month into treatment dem- onstrated sparse tumor cells with surrounding in ﬂ ammatory in ﬁ l- trate and loss of AE1/AE3 staining (Fig. 2). This was felt to be consistent with an initial response to treatment in the setting of an infectious/in ﬂ ammatory complication as discussed below.

Initial PET-CT showed hypermetabolic mixed sclerotic and lytic bone lesions at the proximal and distal metaphyses of the right tibia and ﬁ bula, right talus and right calcaneus with maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) of 6.2. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative for disease. Overall interval between pre- sentation of symptoms and conclusive diagnosis was 4 months. Amputation was recommended by several experts. After mul- tidisciplinary tumor board and outside expert consultations as well as family m eetings, the f amily agree d to a recommen ded course of Z A (2.3 mg/m 2 /mo, max 4 mg/mo) and sirolimus (SIR, 3 mg/m 2 /d, target trough 8 to 12 ng/mL) as initial therapy with the goal of avoiding amputation. At the time of this writing the patient completed 27 ZA infusions with concurrent SIR without dose modi ﬁ cation or deviation from goal SIR troughs. Treatment was associated with possible bone infection/ in ﬂ am- mation at 5 months that resolved and with mild and manageable bone pain, occa sional low grad e fevers, and tran sient mucosi tis. Partial response was seen on PET-CT at 2 months, with near complete response at 13 months. Subsequent imaging has demonstrated reso- lution of the infectious/in ﬂ ammatory process and sustained remission from 13 months to the present (37 mo) (F igs. 3, 4). He has regained full normal mobility and activity and is now active, playing football.

Follow-up time was unspeci ﬁ ed in 2 cases and otherwise ranged from 10 weeks to 19 years (median 18 mo). Common presenting symptoms included one or more nodules with or withou t pain, including several patients who were initially diagnosed with more common infectious/in ﬂ ammatory conditions or did not present until nodules multiplied or ulcerated prompting biopsy. Two cases were ini tially trea ted with orth opedic surg ery or casting and diagnosed upon routine follow-up imaging or nodule appearance upon cast removal. 1,8 There was no clear rela- tionship between prompt diagnosis and outcome; interval between development of symptoms and diagnosis of PMH, where re ported, was hi ghly varia ble. In one cas e, a patient presented after a year-long history of painful lower extremity skin lesi ons and required a mputation of a toe but re mained disease-free at 2 years ’ follow-up afterwards. 9 Conversely, 2 cases with terminal or metastatic outcomes saw a delay to diagno sis of only 1 to 3 mont hs. 1,11 Lower extremity disease was the in itial lesion i n 13 patients , compared wit h 4 with upper extremity lesions, 2 with primary truncal lesions, and a single case of perioral soft tissue nodules. Of these 20 patients, 7 received some form of systemic therapy, 1,2,9,14,16 only 2 of which did so as part of an initial/ primary treatment plan. 1,16 These include a 22-year-old male who received conventional chemotherapy and wide excision without achieving disease control and subsequently was treated with everolimus resulting in treatment response and unspeci ﬁ ed disease status at 5 months. 16 In 2 cases, the speci ﬁ c chemotherapy agent was not speci ﬁ ed. 2,9 All but 3 patients (85%) were treated surgically at ﬁ rst presentation; an 18-year-old male with upper extremity disease who received classical chemotherapy before simple excision eventually developed pulmonary metastases and represents the single con ﬁ rmed fatality in this review 1 — a second patient was noted to be alive with probable lung metastases at 3 months. 9 A 30-year-old male patient refused amputation and opted for metronomic oral cyclo- phosphamide and prednisone resulting in treatment failure and amputation at 10 months. 13 Five amputations were performed in total including one above the knee and one hemipelvectomy. 1,9,10,13,14 Local radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and/or radiotherapy (RT) were used to supplement FIGURE 1.

DISCUSSION It remains very dif ﬁ cult to comment on incidence and prevalence. To the best of our knowledge, our selected cases represent the largest single review of pediatric and of adoles- cent and young adult cases of PMH to date, with Hornick and Fletcher ’ s 2011 review of 50 cases representing the largest age- unrestricted collection. 3 In keeping w ith other public ations, we saw a male predo minance (65 % vs. 35%) and a high frequency of involvement of multiple tissue planes (bone, muscle, subcutaneous and subdermal fat, and/or skin). A majority (75%) of cases involved multiple sites at presentation, and 85% pr esented wit h disease in a s ingle extre mity, simila r to our patient. We also believe that our patient is the youngest reported PMH. In addition our patients multiple primary were con ﬁ ned to bone (se en in only 10% of r eviewed cas es) with only 3 such cases previously described. 13 Our review found th at recurren ces at the same s ite with uncom mon local spread and rarely metastasis are reported. In our literature review, we did not ﬁ nd clear associations or hypotheses regarding speci ﬁ c environmental, metabolic, FIGURE 3. Follow up imaging at 36 months.

In tissue biopsy studies by Trombet ta et al, 17 howeve r, metaphase FI SH demon- strate d a balanced t(7 ;19)(q22;q 13) translo cation in al l sam- ples tested, and an unbalanced der(7)t(7;19)(q22;q13) t(7;19) in 1 of 9 samples tested. This translocation has since been found to co de for a SERPIN E1-FOSB fusi on protein. 5 This gene product results in abnormal constitutive expressio n of FOSB, which contributes to the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex known to be involved in a range of cell growt h and different iation proc esses. 5,22, 23 In at least 2 cases of PMH, this translo cation was the only identi ﬁ ed cytoge netic abnor mality and is t herefore a l ikely candi date for the initiating event in the natural history of this disease. 5,17 In the year s following it s initial dis covery, this transloc ation has been fre quently desc ribed as a char acteristic feature of PMH. 22,2 4,25 However, direct con ﬁ rmation of its presence is rare in our r eview of cases involving yo ung patient s, with only one recent (post-2011) case report including this data. Other genetic ﬁ ndings reported in PMH include Tuberous Sclerosi s 1 (TSC1) m utation in on e tumor, whic h was the basi s for selection of the mTOR-inhibitor drug, everolimus as systemic therapy in that patient. 18 O u ro w ne f f o r t st op e r f o r mn e x t generation testing, after 2 failed attempts showed a FOSB- ACTB gene fus ion thought to be su pportive of the his tologic diagno sis of PMH (per sonal commu nication wit h Denis Adams, H arvard). USE OF SIROLIMUS: No systemic therapies are FDA approved for treatment of PMH. However, sirolimus is one of the ﬁ rst systematic agents to show ef ﬁ cacy in the treatment of complex vascular malformations. SIR inhibits mTOR by allosteric interaction with the FK506 binding protein, although its full mechanism(s) of action are felt to be incompletely understood. The mTOR pathway is involved in regulation of a wide range of crucial cell func- tions, including angiogenesis, cell division, cell motility, and protein synthesis, and responds to a wide range of inputs, notably tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGFr and the PI3k/AKT axis. 26,27 As such, SIR and its analogues have been the subject of considerable interest in the treatment of neoplastic disease. In some studies constituent endothelial cell overexpression of targets of mTOR, such as cKit, have been identi ﬁ ed. 28 The exact role of these differences in gene expression in the pathogenesis, progression, and response to treatment with mTOR inhibition has not been elucidated. Sirolimus has been a successful systemic agent in the treatment of rare complex vascular malformations, including Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, which shares some fea- tures with PMH, forming the basis for our outside consultation and the recommend use and tolerability of SIR. 26,28 – 30 Use of Zoledronic Acid As a bisphosphonate, Zoledronic acid has been found to have many bene ﬁ ts in bone disease and thus given the unusually bony involvement for our patient and the very real possibility of pathologic fracture and need for ampu- tation it was thought that ZA was reasonable to add to SIR. Zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclast activity through com- petitive binding to hydroxyapatite crystal in sites of actively remodeling bone, preventing normal pyrophosphate-mediated resorption. ZA also contributes to osteoclast apoptosis by inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. 21 Its hypothe- sized utility in cancer includes both mitigation of skeletal instability because of metastases and disruption of the osteo- clast-supported microenvironment that favors tumor cell sur- vival, growth, and proliferation within primary and metastatic bony lesions. Recently, additional direct antitumor effects have been suggested 21,31 although this remains poorly characterized. A study of bisphosphonate use in low-risk breast cancer showed reduced incidence of bony metastase s and overall mortality at 6-year follow-up 21 and ZA has also shown ef ﬁ cacy in reducing morbidity and rat e of disease progression in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and multiple myeloma. 31,32 Its utility in bony sarcomas has been promising in preclinical models 31 and is well-tolerated in both adult and pediatric populations. 32,33 ZA is the subject of an ongoing phase II clinical trial in Ewing Sarcoma. 34 However, no bene ﬁ t was se en to addi ng ZA to sta ndard c hemotherapy in a randomized ph ase III trial in osteosar coma. 35 In our patient with PMH of bone wh o responded to thera py with ZA and SIR, it is not possib le to determine the extent to wh ich ZA contribut ed to tumor response. Howev er, it is possible to hypothesi ze that ZA contributed to prot ection against skel- etal-relat ed events (SRE), such as pat hologic fracture in ou r efforts to avoid or dela y ablative surgery. Limb Sparing in PMH Limb-s paring ther apies attem pted in previo us cases have include d surgery, r adiation, a nd radiofre quency abla tion (RFA) wit h their atte ndant morbi dities, suc h as limb inst a- bility , permanent t issue damag e, risk of sar coma induct ion and dysfunction in an active child. To our knowledge, this is ﬁ rst repo rted case of a ttempted li mb sparing wi th systemic therapy, where the other choices were felt to have too great a morbidity by the family and the treating team. Study Limitations As with previous reviews, our review of children and young adults did not uncover any speci ﬁ c indicator(s) of metastatic potential or any high-risk subpopulation. The effect of ZA and SIR on the patient ’ s long-term risk of metastasis, recurrence, and progression, are not known nor are the long-term side effects. Potential long-term compli- cations/late effects of ZA and sirolimus potentially include osteonecrosis, renal impairment, reduced fertility, hyper- triglycer idemia, hyperchole sterolemia, and hype rtension. 36 – 38 CONCLUSIONS The successful use of systemic therapy as primary treatment for PMH is an important development both for patients who are ineligible for or refuse more aggressive therapy and for patients who may receive greater bene ﬁ t with combined systemic and local therapies than they would from standard wide excision alone. It is hoped systemic therapy may mitigate risk of metastasis and, local recur- rence which exceeded metastasis as a consequence of failure of disease control. This report must be interpreted cau- tiously, as data on this disease remains limited and pre- viously reported outcomes of systemic therapy demonstrate marked variation. Patients and families should be counseled on these unknowns and be prepared to promptly escalate to the more invasive standard of care in the event of treatment failure. Patients who are offered systemic treatment such as SIR+ZA should be followed closely, and further research is required to inform providers as to the optimal frequency and duration of follow-up.

Increasing clinical study, clinical experience, genetic, and biological understanding of PMH will hopefully reduce the need for radical local control and increase the options for young patients with PMH.

Three case reports of pediatric PHE showed that everolimus and sirolimus were effective as the first-line or later-line treatment. [8][9] [10] In adults, only one case report has demonstrated at most a mild clinical response to everolimus as the second-line salvage. [5] Whether everolimus can provide significant clinical benefits in adult patients as a front-line treatment has not been previously reported. ... ... [2] The molecular consequences of the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion remained elusive until 2020 when the molecular mechanism of PHE was investigated using a human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model. [10] In this model, hiPSCs engineered to express the SERPINE1-FOSB fusion were shown to successfully recapitulate the phenotypic and functional features of PHE, making it a useful model to study the tumorigenic mechanisms of PHE. The SERPINE1-FOSB fusion was shown to cause an increase in the expression of FOSB, which resulted in VEGF-independent endothelial cell proliferation. ... ... Another successful case of sirolimus treatment was reported by Danforth et al. in a 6-year-old boy with multifocal PHE on the leg. [10] Amputation was initially suggested but was later successfully avoided after treatment with sirolimus and zoledronic acid. A complete metabolic response on PET-CT was seen at 13 months, and the patient had a normal functional life. ... DerekDe-Rui Huang Yi-Hua Liao Jen-Chieh Lee TomWei-Wu Chen Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a rare vascular tumor harboring the pathognomonic SERPINE1-FOSB fusion. Most patients are treated primarily with surgical resection, but some patients require systemic therapy due to multiple metastases at initial presentation or multifocal recurrence after definitive resection. The most optimal treatment strategy for the disease has yet to be clearly defined; however, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors show promise-given–reported anecdotal responses from case reports of pediatric patients. We present an adult patient with multifocal PHE who was successfully treated with everolimus with a significant clinical response. ... Recently, mTOR inhibitors (including everolimus and sirolimus) [12,14,15, 22, 26,27,30] and anti-resorptive treatments [18,19,22] were considered as alternative treatment options, especially in multifocal lesions. ... ... Recently, mTOR inhibitors (including everolimus and sirolimus) [12,14,15,22,26,27,30] and anti-resorptive treatments [18,19, 22] were considered as alternative treatment options, especially in multifocal lesions. ... ... At the time the current case was diagnosed (June 2018), there were no published articles reporting treatment of PMH with zoledronate (Danforth OM, et al. 2019 [22] ) or denosumab (Otani S, et al. 2019 [19]; Panagopoulos I, et al. 2019 [18]). mTOR inhibitors have been identified as a promising target in many sarcomas, including perivascular epithelioid cell tumors [42]. ... Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) can be a challenge for diagnosis and might be confused with other tumors, such as epithelioid sarcoma. Here we present a case and a systematic review of the literature to identify and discuss PMH treatment in primary bone involvement. A 25-year-old woman was referred for bone pain (10/10) in the left lower limb. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple bone lesions (left femur, tibia, patella, ankle, and foot) with well-defined borders without signs of local aggressiveness. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) showed multiple metabolic musculoskeletal lesions in the left lower limb. A CT scan-guided biopsy was performed. Histological and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of PMH. After treatment with intravenous pamidronate (90 mg/monthly), the patient had clinical improvement, mild pain 2/10 without the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opiates. Follow-up was assessed by MRI and PET-CT. PET-CT showed metabolic resolution of most of the bone and muscular lesions and a significant improvement of the femoral lesion. MRI showed that the lesions in the left femur, tibia, and foot had a marked decrease in size without intravenous post-contrast enhancement and smaller lesions had disappeared. After a 3-year follow-up, PET-CT showed no metabolically active images. Literature review identified 31 records including 58 clinical cases of PMH with primary bone involvement and treatment description for qualitative analysis. Most lesions (69%) were treated by local excision or curettage. In addition, amputations were performed in a significant percentage of cases (20.7%). In the last years, mTOR inhibitors (n = 7) and anti-resorptive treatments (n = 4) were considered as alternative treatment options, especially in multifocal lesions. ... 12 In contrast, several targeted drugs, such as sirolimus, everolimus, and telatinib, have shown efficacy with fewer side effects than chemotherapy. [12] [13] [14][15][16] Unfortunately, the low incidence of PHE does not allow investigators to perform systematic clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of a specific treatment, and long-term follow-up data for a specific treatment are limited. Therefore, no systemic therapies have been officially approved for the management of PHE. ... ... 18 mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus and everolimus, have been effectively used for targeted therapy of PHE. [12] [13] [14][15] However, the genetic information for mTOR inhibitor-responsive cases is limited. In some cases, the genetic information was missing, 14 while in others, although a translocation or gene fusion was reported, the translational products of the fusion gene were not described. ... ... In some cases, the genetic information was missing, 14 while in others, although a translocation or gene fusion was reported, the translational products of the fusion gene were not described. 13, 15 Most recently, Bridge et al. 7 reported a CLTC-FOSB fusion gene resulting in a chimeric protein in a case of PHE, and the tumor was responsive to sirolimus therapy. In our study, we clearly correlated the effectiveness of sirolimus therapy with a PHErelated genetic aberration, that is, a SERPINE1-FOSB fusion resulting in overexpression of intact FOSB. ... Jun Ren Xiaohui Wang Yulin Zhou Qiwei Guo Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is an extremely rare disease that affects mainly the young and more men than women. PHE are multicentric, locally aggressive, have low metastatic potential, and affect multiple tissue planes. Genetic aberrations are frequently detected in PHE and may play important roles in the occurrence, development, and treatment of this disease. In this study, we report a case of PHE with a novel SERPINE1‐FOSB fusion gene. The fusion introduced a strong promoter near the coding region of FOSB, resulting in overexpression of intact FOSB. Immunohistochemical analysis showed overexpression of pAKT and mTOR in tumor cells, suggesting activation of the PI3K‐AKT‐mTOR signaling pathway. The patient responded well to targeted therapy with sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. Our study correlated dysregulation of a specific signaling pathway and the effectiveness of a targeted therapy to a specific genetic aberration. This information may be useful for future investigations of targeted therapeutics and provide a potential predictive biomarker for therapeutic effectiveness in PHE cases. Douglas Dias e Silva Camila Bobato Lara Gismondi Murilo Marques Almeida Silva Roberto Carmagnani Pestana Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is an ultra-rare vascular sarcoma that most commonly affects young adults, with a male predominance. It is diagnosed using a combination of imaging studies, histopathological examinations, and immunohistochemical staining. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, with the goal of achieving a wide local excision and reducing the risk of recurrence. The role of systemic therapies is not well established because of the rarity of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma, uncertainty regarding its response to currently approved medications, and lack of randomized controlled trials. We describe the case of an 18-year-old male patient diagnosed with multifocal pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma of the left lower limb who was treated with everolimus in addition to denosumab, achieving a partial response that was consolidated with resection, radiofrequency ablation, and radiotherapy of multiple local lesions, achieving a long-lasting response. Following subsequent disease progression, the patient responded favorably to pazopanib, with no significant toxicities.\nKeywords: Hemangioendothelioma; Hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid; Neoplasms, vascular tissue; Everolimus; Denosumab; Pazopanib Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a rare angiogenic tumor. Histologically, the morphological characteristics of neoplastic vessels and endothelial differentiation are not obvious, and it is easy to be confused with epithelioid sarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and myogenic tumor. PHE usually occurs in arms and legs in young people and has a significant male predominance. The tumor has a predilection for the distal extremities and its typical manifestation is multiple center invasion of a single limb, which can involve all layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues,and is often accompanied by abvious pain. Histologically, PHE is characterized by infiltrative growth of tumor. Most tumor lesions are composed of sheets and loose fascicles of plump spindle or epithelioid cells within a background of variably prominent inflammatory infiltration, which was commonly composed of neutrophils. Some cells may resemble rhabdomyoblasts, and nuclear atypia and mitosis were rare. The tumor cells generally expressed positive cytokeratin (CK), ETS-related gene (ERG), Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) and integrase interactor 1(INI1). In some cases, the tumor cells expressed CD31. A case of a young woman was reported in this paper, who presented with a subcutaneous mass with severe pain and was chronologically misdiagnosed with herpes zoster, low-grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. In this study, the clinical and pathological features, differential diagnosis and the latest progress in therapy of PHE were analyzed based on relevant literature. Andrew W Swarbrick Aaron J Frederiks Rachael S Foster Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORI) with anti‐proliferative, antiangiogenic and immunosuppressive properties. While approved in Australia as an anti‐rejection medication for renal transplant patients, there is mounting evidence regarding the utility of oral and topical sirolimus in treating a plethora of dermatological conditions or conditions with cutaneous manifestations. Our aim was to present an overview of the evidence for current usage and breadth of the application of sirolimus in dermatology. We carried out a systematic review of all the literature published up to 31 August 2019 on oral and topical sirolimus with respect to dermatological conditions or conditions otherwise relevant to dermatology. While 3368 papers were initially produced in our search, 238 papers met our inclusion criteria and were examined in our review. The conditions examined were categorised into genodermatoses (9 conditions), infection (1 condition), inflammatory/autoimmune (10 conditions), neoplasm (3 conditions) and vascular (17 conditions). We extracted data on first author, publication year, journal, characteristics of the study and study patients, condition, drug modalities, drug efficacy, side effects, blood level of mTORI, co‐interventions and follow‐up. While there is level 1 evidence for the efficacy of sirolimus in conditions such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and GVHD prophylaxis, for many other conditions, the evidence is limited to level 4 evidence. Regarding oral systemic therapy, dosing regimens varied with the most common for children 0.8mg/m2 twice daily and for adults 1 mg twice daily. Doses were often adjusted to reach a typical trough level of between 5 and 15 ng/mL, though targets often varied. In the overall majority of cases, side effects were minimal or tolerable, including mucositis, cytopenias, lipid abnormalities and nausea/vomiting, and only a few cases had to stop due to adverse effects. Regarding topical therapy, concentration of formulations varied from 0.1% to 1% and were compounded into creams, ointments or gels and administered typically once or twice per day. The most common side effect was skin irritation. There were a number of limitations to our study. In particular, many of the published studies were case reports or case series with no comparator arm, leading to susceptibility of bias in conclusions drawn, in particular a high likelihood of publication bias. Given the heterogeneity amongst studies, comparisons or aggregation of results was difficult. There continues to be growing use of oral and topical sirolimus in dermatological conditions. It provides new therapeutic options to patients where previous therapies have either failed or are limited due to toxicity. However, further studies are warranted. Zoledronic acid, a highly potent intravenous bisphosphonate, has been increasingly used in children with primary and secondary osteoporosis due to its convenience of shorter infusion time and less frequent dosing compared to pamidronate. Many studies have also demonstrated beneficial effects of zoledronic acid in other conditions such as hypercalcemia of malignancy, fibrous dysplasia, chemotherapy-related osteonecrosis and metastatic bone disease. This review summarizes pharmacologic properties, mechanism of action, dosing regimen, and therapeutic outcomes of zoledronic acid in a variety of metabolic bone disorders in children. Several potential novel uses of zoledronic acid are also discussed. Safety concerns and adverse effects are also highlighted. Robert Martin Conry Michael G. Rodriguez Joseph G Pressey Background\nZoledronic acid (ZA) is a third-generation bisphosphonate in widespread clinical use to reduce pain and skeletal events in patients from a variety of malignancies with bone metastases. Pre-clinical studies indicate that ZA inhibits osteosarcoma through direct anti-proliferative effects, immune activation and anti-angiogenic activity.\nMethods\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of ZA at standard dose until progression in patients with stage IV osteosarcoma lacking a standard of care treatment option proven to influence survival. Researchers retrospectively reviewed medical records of all patients at our institution with high-grade osteosarcoma presumed to be incurable due",

      "raw": "Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PMH) is a recently described, indolent vascular tumor that usually presents in the distal extremities. PMH typically has a multi-focal presentation and can involve several tissue planes including the dermis, subcutis, muscle, and bone. This soft tissue tumor predominantly affects men between 20 and 50 years of age. PMH tumors typically are resected but frequently recur locally; thus, more efficacious treatment options are needed. Herein, we report two cases of patients with PMH who were treated with systemic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, our report is the first to describe a response of PMH either to gemcitabine/taxane cytotoxic chemotherapy or to a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. In the first case, a 45-year-old man with PMH of the right ilium was treated with gemcitabine plus docetaxel. Although chemotherapy was ultimately halted owing to gemcitabine-induced pulmonary toxicity, positron emission tomography-computer tomography scans taken after three cycles of gemcitabine plus docetaxel illustrated a noticeable response to the regimen. In the second case, a 22-year-old man with PMH of the right distal femur and metastases in the left ilium showed no response to gemcitabine plus docetaxel therapy, but underwent surgical resection after cisplatin and doxorubicin resulted in stable disease. DNA sequencing of his tumor revealed the presence of a tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) mutation, so daily everolimus, which inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin, was started. Two months after beginning everolimus, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis, which revealed mild shrinkage of PMH metastases in the left iliac bone. Despite the apparent heterogeneity of response to gemcitabine/taxane chemotherapy in our two patients, these two cases indicate that gemcitabine/taxane and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor may serve as systemic treatment options for PMH and warrant further investigation.",

Sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, produced rapid and dramatic improvement of the Kasabach–Merritt phenomenon and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma shrinkage. Eventually, multifocal lesions of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma disappeared on the images of magnetic resonance imaging and have remained in remission for 27 months after sirolimus cessation. We demonstrated that the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway played a pivotal role in the kaposiform hemangioendothelioma growth.

      "raw": "Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have shown promising results in the management of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE). The purpose of this study was to present our experience involving sirolimus therapy for KHE. A retrospective study was conducted to review the medical documents of 26 patients with KHE who were treated with sirolimus at our hospital between March 2012 and December 2016. Fifteen males and 11 females manifested KHE in infancy with an average age of 2.9 ± 1.8 months. Multiple anatomical sites were involved. Four patients had multifocal lesions, while 22 patients had solitary lesions. Twenty‐five patients had Kasabach–Merritt phenomenon (KMP). Twenty patients completed sirolimus therapy in 28.3 ± 12.5 months. Nineteen KHE lesions reduced to small residuals with platelet counts reaching normal levels 3.7 ± 2.8 weeks after treatment; one KHE lesion had no response to therapy. One patient with multifocal lesions died due to a severe infection, although the patient had previously responded to sirolimus. Five patients remained in treatment and had good responses with normal platelet counts. Nineteen patients with anemia had normal hemoglobin levels after 3.5 ± 1.9 weeks of treatment. Mild side effects were observed. The median follow‐up time was 32 months (26–60 months), with no evidence of recurrences. Sirolimus was shown to be efficacious in the management of KHE with an average course of 28 months. The time‐to‐response was variable, with an average of 1 week. After 4 weeks of treatment, the platelet count and hemoglobin level had normalized. Multifocal KHE with KMP is more severe than solitary KHE.",

      "raw": "Combining with engineering examples, the influence of grouting on the stability of foundation pit is analyzed by comparing the parameters before and after grouting. The numerical analysis software FLAC is used to simulate the original foundation pit without grouting. The relationship between the maximum horizontal displacement and cohesion, friction angle and elastic modulus is explored. The fitting formulas of the influence of elastic modulus, friction angle and cohesion on displacement are put forward. Enclosure design provides basic data.",
