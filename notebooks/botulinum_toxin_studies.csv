"Botulinum toxin type A (BONT-A) has shown promise in improving the mood-related symptoms of psychiatric disorders by targeting muscles linked to the expression of negative emotions. We conducted a systematic review of past and ongoing efficacy trials of BONT-A therapy for psychiatric disorders to identify relevant trends in the field and discuss the refinement of therapeutic techniques. A comprehensive search for published clinical trials using BONT-A injections for psychiatric disorders was performed on 4 May 2023 through OVID databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO). Unpublished clinical trials were searched through the ClinicalTrials.gov and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform public registries. The risk of bias was assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal tools for use in systematic reviews. We identified 21 studies (17 published, 4 unpublished clinical trials) involving 471 patients. The studies focused on evaluating the efficacy of BONT-A for major depressive, borderline personality, social anxiety, and bipolar disorders. BONT-A was most commonly injected into the glabellar area, with an average dose ranging between 37.75 U and 44.5 U in published studies and between 32.7 U and 41.3 U in unpublished trials. The results indicated significant symptom reductions across all the studied psychiatric conditions, with mild adverse effects. Thus, BONT-A appears to be safe and well-tolerated for psychiatric disorders of negative affectivity. However, despite the clinical focus, there was a noted shortage of biomarker-related assessments. Future studies should focus on pursuing mechanistic explorations of BONT-A effects at the neurobiological level.",systematic_review,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38668616/,Botulinum Toxin Injections for Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review of the Clinical Trial Landscape
"Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a presynaptic inhibitor of acetylcholine (Ach) release at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), is a successful and safe drug for the treatment of several neurological disorders. However, a wide and recent literature review has demonstrated that BoNT exerts its effects not only at the ""periphery"" but also within the central nervous system (CNS). Studies from animal models, in fact, have shown a retrograde transport to the CNS, thus modulating synaptic function. The increasing number of articles reporting efficacy of BoNT on chronic neuropathic pain (CNP), a complex disease of the CNS, demonstrates that the central mechanisms of BoNT are far from being completely elucidated. In this new light, BoNT might interfere with the activity of spinal, brain stem, and cortical circuitry, modulating excitability and the functional organization of CNS in healthy conditions. Botulinum toxins efficacy on CNP is the result of a wide and complex action on many and diverse mechanisms at the basis of the maladaptive plasticity, the core of the pathogenesis of CNP. This systematic review aims to discuss in detail the BoNT's mechanisms and effects on peripheral and central neuroplasticity, at the basis for the clinical efficacy in CNP syndromes.",systematic_review,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38452215/,Peripheral and central neurobiological effects of botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) in neuropathic pain: a systematic review
"Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) encompass several conditions that cause pain and impair function of the masticatory muscles (M-TMDs) and temporomandibular joints. There is a large interest among clinicians and researchers in the use of botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) as a treatment for M-TMD. However, due to the lack of consistent evidence regarding the efficacy as well as adverse events of BoNT-A, clinical decision making is challenging. Therefore, this umbrella review aimed to systematically assess systematic reviews (SRs) evaluating BoNT-A treatment effects on pain intensity, mandibular movements, and adverse events in patients with M-TMDs. An electronic search was undertaken in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Epistemonikos, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP to identify SRs investigating BoNT-A effects on M-TMDs, published from the inception of each database until 6 December 2023. The quality of evidence was rated according to the critical appraisal checklist developed by the umbrella review methodology working group. Only high-quality SRs were included. In total, 18 SRs were included. BoNT-A was shown to be more effective than placebo to reduce pain intensity, but not compared to standard treatments. Additionally, BoNT-A was not superior to placebo or standard treatments regarding improvement of mandibular movements. BoNT-A was considered to have a higher risk for adverse events on muscle and bony tissue compared with other treatments. The synthesis in this umbrella review provides the highest level of evidence present. Taken together, there are indications of effectiveness of BoNT-A for treatment of M-TMDs, supported by moderate evidence. However, considering the risk of causing serious adverse events, treatment with BoNT-A is recommended to be the last treatment alternative.",systematic_review,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38900335/,Botulinum Toxin-A for the Treatment of Myogenous Temporomandibular Disorders: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews

"Background: Psychological interventions are increasingly discussed as a method to prevent major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults who already experience subthreshold depressive symptoms. In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we quantify the effect of preventive interventions against control on MDD onset in this population, and explore effect modifiers. Methods: In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we screened full-texts of eligible studies within the Metapsy research domain for articles on psychological interventions for depression, from database inception to May 1, 2023, published in English, German, Spanish, and Dutch. We included individual participant data of randomised trials comparing psychological interventions with a control group regarding their effects on MDD onset in adults with subthreshold depressive symptoms but no MDD at baseline, confirmed by standardised diagnostic interviews. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool. Effect on the onset of MDD (the primary outcome) and moderators were analysed using one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis. Survival analyses were conducted to examine effects on time to MDD onset within 12 months. We involved people with related lived experience in the study design and implementation. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017058585. Findings: 30 of 42 eligible randomised controlled trials with 7201 participants (2227 [30·9%] male, 4957 [68·9%] female, and 17 [0·2%] preferred not to report their sex) were included in our analysis (3697 participants had intervention and 3504 participants had control). The mean age of participants was 49·9 years (SD 19·2). Of the 3152 participants with reported ethnicity, 1608 (51·0%) were White. Five studies received a high risk of bias rating. Psychological interventions were associated with significantly reduced MDD incidence at post-treatment (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·57 [95% CI 0·35-0·93]; τ2=0·29; 18 studies), within 6 months (0·58 [0·39-0·88]; τ2=0·11; 18 studies), and within 12 months (0·67 [0·51-0·88]; τ2=0·05; 19 studies). No significant effect was observed at 24 months (IRR 1·16 [95% CI 0·66-2·03]; τ2=0·10; six studies). Preventive effects were stronger for individuals who had not previously had psychotherapy (IRR 0·39 [95% CI 0·25-0·62]) compared with those who had received psychotherapy before (0·92 [0·61-1·36]; p=0·029; seven studies). Although no overall linear association was identified, higher baseline depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety symptom (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) scores were associated with greater reductions in MDD onset risk. On the study level, delivery type appeared to moderate outcomes, with conference telephone calls being more effective than delivery via face-to-face, internet-based, and other formats (p=0·002), albeit based on only two studies of conference telephone calls with four comparisons. Other factors (eg, age) showed no significant differential effects. Interpretation: Our findings show the effectiveness of preventive psychological interventions for subthreshold depressive symptoms. Tailoring interventions to consider participant-level and study-level factors could help to increase the impact of such interventions on a population level.",systematic_review,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39572120/,Psychological interventions to prevent the onset of major depression in adults: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis
"Botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A) injections are effective for focal spasticity. However, the impact on muscle strength is not established. This study aimed to investigate the effect of BoNT-A injections on muscle strength in adult neurological conditions. Studies were included if they were Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, or cohort studies (n ≥ 10) involving participants ≥18 years old receiving BoNT-A injection for spasticity in their upper and/or lower limbs. Eight databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Medline, PEDro, Pubmed, Web of Science) were searched in March 2024. The methodology followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42022315241). Quality was assessed using the modified Downs and Black checklist and the PEDro scale. Pre-/post-injection agonist, antagonist, and global strength outcomes at short-, medium-, and long-term time points were extracted for analysis. Following duplicate removal, 8536 studies were identified; 54 met the inclusion criteria (3176 participants) and were rated as fair-quality. Twenty studies were analysed as they reported muscle strength specific to the muscle injected. No change in agonist strength after BoNT-A injection was reported in 74% of the results. Most studies' outcomes were within six weeks post-injection, with few long-term results (i.e., >three months). Overall, the impact of BoNT-A on muscle strength remains inconclusive.",systematic_review,2024,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11359732/,The Effect of Botulinum Neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A) on Muscle Strength in Adult-Onset Neurological Conditions with Focal Muscle Spasticity: A Systematic Review
"Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Preliminary evidence suggests that glabellar onabotulinumtoxinA injections improve depression scores with few side effects compared to current first-line antidepressant medications. The authors' review reports on these studies, hypothesizing that glabellar onabotulinumtoxinA injections can be an alternative safe and effective treatment for depression. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched in August of 2020 using the keywords [""botox"" OR ""botulinum""] AND [""mood"" OR ""depression""] for articles published between 1980 and 2020. Prospective studies and randomized controlled trials on the use of glabellar onabotulinumtoxinA injections for the primary purpose of treating depression were considered. The primary endpoint for the meta-analysis was the mean difference in primary depression scores after treatment, along with a second endpoint of the standardized mean difference in depression scores among treated patients including all nine studies. Results: Of the 499 reviewed articles, nine studies were included that reported improvement in mean depression scores from baseline. All five randomized controlled trials reported an improvement in mean depression scores at 6 weeks after treatment, with a weighted average change of -8.39 points ( p < 0.0001). The aggregate standardized mean difference from baseline to the primary endpoint across all nine prospective studies was -1.61 SD ( p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Meta-analysis and systematic review of the included studies provide support for an antidepressant effect of glabellar onabotulinumtoxinA injections.

"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted from January 2005 to June 2021 to update the evidence of Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) in neuropathic pain (NP) in addition to quality of life (QOL), mental health, and sleep outcomes. We conducted a Cochrane Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria analysis of RCTs from the following data sources: EMBASE, CINAHL, WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane database, Cochrane Clinical Trial Register, Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and EU Clinical Trials Register. Meta-analysis of 17 studies showed a mean final VAS reduction in pain in the intervention group of 2.59 units (95% confidence interval: 1.79, 3.38) greater than the mean for the placebo group. The overall mean difference for sleep, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety, HADS depression, and QOL mental and physical sub-scales were, respectively, 1.10 (95% CI: -1.71, 3.90), 1.41 (95% CI: -0.61, 3.43), -0.16 (95% CI: -1.95, 1.63), 0.85 (95% CI: -1.85, 3.56), and -0.71 (95% CI: -3.39, 1.97), indicating no significance. BoNT-A is effective for NP; however, small-scale RCTs to date have been limited in evidence. The reasons for this are discussed, and methods for future RCTs are developed to establish BoNT-A as the first-line agent.",systematic_review,2022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35051013/,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A for Neuropathic Pain
"The effects of psychotherapies for depression have been examined in several hundreds of randomized trials, but no recent network meta-analysis (NMA) has integrated the results of these studies. We conducted an NMA of trials comparing cognitive behavioural, interpersonal, psychodynamic, problem-solving, behavioural activation, life-review and ""third wave"" therapies and non-directive supportive counseling with each other and with care-as-usual, waiting list and pill placebo control conditions. Response (50% reduction in symptoms) was the primary outcome, but we also assessed remission, standardized mean difference, and acceptability (all-cause dropout rate). Random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses were conducted on 331 randomized trials with 34,285 patients. All therapies were more efficacious than care-as-usual and waiting list control conditions, and all therapies - except non-directive supportive counseling and psychodynamic therapy - were more efficacious than pill placebo. Standardized mean differences compared with care-as-usual ranged from -0.81 for life-review therapy to -0.32 for non-directive supportive counseling. Individual psychotherapies did not differ significantly from each other, with the only exception of non-directive supportive counseling, which was less efficacious than all other therapies. The results were similar when only studies with low risk of bias were included. Most therapies still had significant effects at 12-month follow-up compared to care-as-usual, and problem-solving therapy was found to have a somewhat higher long-term efficacy than some other therapies. No consistent differences in acceptability were found. Our conclusion is that the most important types of psychotherapy are efficacious and acceptable in the acute treatment of adult depression, with few significant differences between them. Patient preference and availability of each treatment type may play a larger role in the choice between types of psychotherapy, although it is possible that a more detailed characterization of patients with a diagnosis of depression may lead to a more precise matching between individual patients and individual psychotherapies.",systematic_review,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34002502/,"Psychotherapies for depression: a network meta-analysis covering efficacy, acceptability and long-term outcomes of all main treatment types"
"Background: Before 2020, mental disorders were leading causes of the global health-related burden, with depressive and anxiety disorders being leading contributors to this burden. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment where many determinants of poor mental health are exacerbated. The need for up-to-date information on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 in a way that informs health system responses is imperative. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders globally in 2020. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of data reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and published between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, and consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders that were representative of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a pre-pandemic baseline. We used the assembled data in a meta-regression to estimate change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders between pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic (using periods as defined by each study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, and daily excess mortality rate). We then used this model to estimate the change from pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 [known as DisMod-MR 2.1]) by age, sex, and location. We used final prevalence estimates and disability weights to estimate years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Findings: We identified 5683 unique data sources, of which 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria for major depressive disorder and 27 for anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and reductions in human mobility, were associated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (regression coefficient [B] 0·9 [95% uncertainty interval 0·1 to 1·8; p=0·029] for human mobility, 18·1 [7·9 to 28·3; p=0·0005] for daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) and anxiety disorders (0·9 [0·1 to 1·7; p=0·022] and 13·8 [10·7 to 17·0; p<0·0001]. Females were affected more by the pandemic than males (B 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders) and younger age groups were more affected than older age groups (-0·007 [-0·009 to -0·006; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, -0·003 [-0·005 to -0·002; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders). We estimated that the locations hit hardest by the pandemic in 2020, as measured with decreased human mobility and daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, had the greatest increases in prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We estimated an additional 53·2 million (44·8 to 62·9) cases of major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 27·6% [25·1 to 30·3]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that the total prevalence was 3152·9 cases (2722·5 to 3654·5) per 100 000 population. We also estimated an additional 76·2 million (64·3 to 90·6) cases of anxiety disorders globally (an increase of 25·6% [23·2 to 28·0]), such that the total prevalence was 4802·4 cases (4108·2 to 5588·6) per 100 000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 49·4 million (33·6 to 68·7) DALYs and anxiety disorders caused 44·5 million (30·2 to 62·5) DALYs globally in 2020. Interpretation: This pandemic has created an increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways to promote mental wellbeing and target determinants of poor mental health and interventions to treat those with a mental disorder. Taking no action to address the burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders should not be an option.",systematic_review,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34634250/,Global prevalence and burden of depressive and anxiety disorders in 204 countries and territories in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic
"Post-stroke spasticity impedes patients' rehabilitation progress. Contradictory evidence has been reported in using Botulinum Neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) to manage post-stroke lower extremity spasticity (PLES); furthermore, an optimum dose of BoNT-A for PLES has not yet been established. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to identify the efficacy and optimal dose of BoNT-A on PLES. ""Meta"" and ""Metafor"" packages in R were used to analyze the data. Hedges' g statistic and random effect model were used to calculate and pool effect sizes. Twelve RCTs met the eligibility criteria. Muscle tone significantly improved in week four, week eight, and maintained to week twelve after BoNT-A injection. Improvements in functional outcomes were found, some inconsistencies among included studies were noticed. Dosage analysis from eight studies using Botox® and three studies using Dysport® indicated that the optimum dose for the commonest pattern of PLES (spastic plantar flexors) is medium-dose (approximately 300U Botox® or 1000 U Dysport®). BoNT-A should be regarded as part of a rehabilitation program for PLES. Furthermore, an optimal rehabilitation program combined with BoNT-A management needs to be established. Further studies should also focus on functional improvement by BoNT-A management in the early stage of stroke.",systematic_review,2021,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8234518/,Efficacy and Optimal Dose of Botulinum Toxin A in Post-Stroke Lower Extremity Spasticity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious mental disorder that represents a substantial public health problem. Several trials have been undertaken to investigate the role of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in the treatment of MDD, but the conclusions were controversial. To examine the efficacy and safety of BTX-A vs. placebo on patients with a clinical diagnosis of MDD, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed and Web of Science from inception to June 17, 2020. All published studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of BTX-A injections on patients with a clinical diagnosis of MDD were included. The overall effect size was summarized using a random-effects meta-analysis model. The primary outcomes of the present meta-analysis were the changes in depressive rating scale at week 6 after BTX-A injection compared with placebo. The safety of BTX-A injections also was assessed. Results: Five RCTs with a total of 417 participants (189 patients in the BTX-A group, 228 patients in placebo group) were eligible in this meta-analysis. The results indicated an overall positive effect of BTX-A injections for reducing the depressive symptoms of patients with MDD (Hedges' g, −0.82; 95% CI, −1.38 to −0.27) with large effect size. Differences are likely explained by the dose of BTX-As and the gender of the participants. Our findings also highlighted that BTX-A injections were generally well-tolerated, with only mild and temporary adverse events reported. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis provides evidence that BTX-A injections are associated with a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms. BTX-A injections are generally safe and may provide a new, alternative option for the treatment of depression.",systematic_review,2020,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7746677/,Efficacy and Safety of Botulinum Toxin vs. Placebo in Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials

"Background: Substantial evidence suggests that cognitive deficits might persist after remission of a major depressive episode. However, results are inconsistent relative to the importance, pattern, severity, and moderating factors of this impairment. We aimed to determine how cognitive function following a major depressive episode compares with normal function, to specify the pattern and severity of persistent cognitive dysfunctions, and to examine the potential moderator effect of ten prespecified clinical and demographic variables. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published research. We searched systematically MEDLINE, Embase, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and relevant reviews identified by our database search, for research published from Jan 1, 1972, up to Jan 31, 2018, for studies of patients with past depression. We included all independent studies of patients who were assessed while in remission from a major depressive episode with at least one cognitive test, with inclusion of a healthy control group assessed with either the same test(s) as the major depressive episode group or with a standardised test with published age-stratified normative data. The main outcome was the difference in cognitive performance between major depressive episode remitters and healthy controls. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models for cognitive outcomes classified into 18 standard domains. Moderators of between-study variability were assessed using mixed-effects subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. Findings: Of 10 126 citations identified by our search, 75 cognitive variables from 252 eligible studies (11 882 major depressive episode remitters and 8533 healthy controls) were included in our meta-analysis. Significant deficits following major depressive episode remission were observed in 55 (73%) of the 75 cognitive variables. These deficits (in the domains of processing speed, visual selective attention, working memory, verbal learning, and executive functioning), were generally small (30 [40%] of the 75 variables) or medium (22 [29%]) in size, although three long-term memory variables showed large deficits: g=-0·81 [95% CI -1·01 to -0·61] for logical memory immediate recall, g=-0·88 [-1·19 to -0·57] for logical memory delayed recall, and g=-0·84 [-1·18 to -0·50] for Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery pattern recognition latency. Auditory attention, general autobiographical memory, inhibition ability unconstrained by speed, and intellectual functioning unconstrained by speed were equivalent between major depressive episode remitters and matched controls. The number of previous depressive episodes explained heterogeneity in the majority of variables (z=-2·06 [p=0·039] to z=-4·26 [p<0·0001]). Interpretation: Deficits in selective attention, working memory, and long-term memory persist in remission from a major depressive episode and worsen with repeated episodes. Depression treatments, including relapse prevention, need to target these cognitive functions to optimise prognosis.",systematic_review,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31422920/,Cognitive function following a major depressive episode: a systematic review and meta-analysis
"Background: Major depressive disorder is one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions. Prescription of these agents should be informed by the best available evidence. Therefore, we aimed to update and expand our previous work to compare and rank antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder. Methods: We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, the websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomised controlled trials from their inception to Jan 8, 2016. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults (≥18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002291. Findings: We identified 28 552 citations and of these included 522 trials comprising 116 477 participants. In terms of efficacy, all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2·13 (95% credible interval [CrI] 1·89-2·41) for amitriptyline and 1·37 (1·16-1·63) for reboxetine. For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0·84, 95% CrI 0·72-0·97) and fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80-0·96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas clomipramine was worse than placebo (1·30, 1·01-1·68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1·15 to 1·55 for efficacy and from 0·64 to 0·83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1·19-1·96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0·51-0·84). For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (range of ORs 0·43-0·77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1·30-2·32). 46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low. Interpretation: All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. Smaller differences between active drugs were found when placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis, whereas there was more variability in efficacy and acceptability in head-to-head trials. These results should serve evidence-based practice and inform patients, physicians, guideline developers, and policy makers on the relative merits of the different antidepressants.",systematic_review,2018,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29477251/,Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
"Objective: The goal of this review was to consolidate the evidence concerning the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (onabotulinumtoxinA) in depression. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Scopus through May 5, 2014, for studies evaluating the efficacy of botulinum toxin A in depression. Only randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. A pooled mean difference in primary depression score, and pooled odds ratio for response and remission rate with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran Q test and χ statistic. Results: Of the 639 articles that were initially retrieved, 5 studies enrolling 194 subjects (age 49±9.6 y) were included in the systematic review, and 3 randomized controlled trials enrolling 134 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a significant decrease in mean primary depression scores among patients who received botulinum toxin A compared with placebo (-9.80; 95% CI, -12.90 to -6.69) with modest heterogeneity between the studies (Cochran Q test, χ=70). Response and remission rates were 8.3 and 4.6 times higher, respectively, among patients receiving botulinum toxin A compared with placebo, with no heterogeneity between the studies. The 2 studies excluded from the meta-analysis also found a significant decrease in primary depression scores in patients after receiving botulinum toxin A. A few subjects had minor side effects, which were similar between the groups receiving botulinum toxin and those receiving placebo. Conclusions: This study suggests that botulinum toxin A can produce significant improvement in depressive symptoms and is a safe adjunctive treatment for patients receiving pharmacotherapy for depression. Future trials are needed to evaluate the antidepressant effect per se of botulinum toxin A and to further elucidate the underlying antidepressant mechanism of botulinum toxin A.",systematic_review,2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27138078/,Role of Botulinum Toxin in Depression
"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are categorised into immunologically distinct serotypes BoNT/A to /G). Each serotype can also be further divided into subtypes based on differences in amino acid sequence. BoNTs are ~150 kDa proteins comprised of three major functional domains: an N-terminal zinc metalloprotease light chain (LC), a translocation domain (HN), and a binding domain (HC). The HC is responsible for targeting the BoNT to the neuronal cell membrane, and each serotype has evolved to bind via different mechanisms to different target receptors. Most structural characterisations to date have focussed on the first identified subtype within each serotype (e.g., BoNT/A1). Subtype differences within BoNT serotypes can affect intoxication, displaying different botulism symptoms in vivo, and less emphasis has been placed on investigating these variants. This review outlines the receptors for each BoNT serotype and describes the basis for the highly specific targeting of neuronal cell membranes. Understanding receptor binding is of vital importance, not only for the generation of novel therapeutics but also for understanding how best to protect from intoxication.",literature_review,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30347838/,Variations in the Botulinum Neurotoxin Binding Domain and the Potential for Novel Therapeutics
"Importance: Approximately 9% of US adults experience major depression each year, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 17% for men and 30% for women. Observations: Major depression is defined by depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, and associated psychological and somatic symptoms lasting at least 2 weeks. Evaluation should include structured assessment of severity as well as risk of self-harm, suspected bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms, substance use, and co-occurring anxiety disorder. First-line treatments include specific psychotherapies and antidepressant medications. A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported cognitive therapy, behavioral activation, problem-solving therapy, interpersonal therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, and mindfulness-based psychotherapy all had at least medium-sized effects in symptom improvement over usual care without psychotherapy (standardized mean difference [SMD] ranging from 0.50 [95% CI, 0.20-0.81] to 0.73 [95% CI, 0.52-0.95]). A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported 21 antidepressant medications all had small- to medium-sized effects in symptom improvement over placebo (SMD ranging from 0.23 [95% CI, 0.19-0.28] for fluoxetine to 0.48 [95% CI, 0.41-0.55] for amitriptyline). Psychotherapy combined with antidepressant medication may be preferred, especially for more severe or chronic depression. A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported greater symptom improvement with combined treatment than with psychotherapy alone (SMD, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.14-0.45]) or medication alone (SMD, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.20-0.47]). When initial antidepressant medication is not effective, second-line medication treatment includes changing antidepressant medication, adding a second antidepressant, or augmenting with a nonantidepressant medication, which have approximately equal likelihood of success based on a network meta-analysis. Collaborative care programs, including systematic follow-up and outcome assessment, improve treatment effectiveness, with 1 meta-analysis reporting significantly greater symptom improvement compared with usual care (SMD, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.23-0.61]). Conclusions and relevance: Effective first-line depression treatments include specific forms of psychotherapy and more than 20 antidepressant medications.

"Multiple randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials have shown that botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A), when injected into the frown musculature, is an antidepressant. This review outlines the conceptual narrative behind this treatment modality, starting with theory developed by Charles Darwin. We develop the concept of emotional proprioception and discuss how the muscles of facial expression play an important role in relaying valenced information to the brain's emotional neuroanatomical circuit. We review the role of facial frown musculature as the brain's barometer and transmitter of negatively valanced emotional information. The direct connections between the corrugator muscles and the amygdala are reviewed, and these provide a neuroanatomical circuit that is a logical target for treatment with BoNT/A. The centrality of amygdala dysfunction in the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders, and the evidence that BoNT/A modulates amygdala activity, provides the mechanistic link between BoNT/A and its antidepressant activity. Animal models of BoNT/A's antidepressant effects confirm the evolutionary conservation of this emotional circuit. The clinical and theoretical implications of this evidence, as it relates to the potential treatment of a broad range of psychiatric disorders by BoNT/A, is discussed. The ease of administration, long duration, and favorable side effect profile of this therapy is reviewed in the context of existing antidepressant treatments.",literature_review,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37235370/,Botulinum Toxin Treatment for Depression: A New Paradigm for Psychiatry

"Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease affecting people older than 50 years and is 2-3 times more common in women. The most common symptoms are pain and morning stiffness in the shoulder and pelvic girdle and the onset may be acute or develop over a few days to weeks. General symptoms such as fatigue, fever and weight loss may occur, likely driven by systemic IL-6 signalling. The pathology includes synovial and periarticular inflammation and muscular vasculopathy. A new observation is that PMR may appear as a side effect of cancer treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The diagnosis of PMR relies mainly on symptoms and signs combined with laboratory markers of inflammation. Imaging modalities including ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with computed tomography are promising new tools in the investigation of suspected PMR. However, they are still limited by availability, high cost and unclear performance in the diagnostic workup. Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is effective in PMR, with most patients responding promptly to 15-25 mg prednisolone per day. There are challenges in the management of patients with PMR as relapses do occur and patients with PMR may need to stay on GC for extended periods. This is associated with high rates of GC-related comorbidities, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, and there are limited data on the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics as GC sparing agents. Finally, PMR is associated with giant cell arteritis that may complicate the disease course and require more intense and prolonged treatment.",literature_review,2022,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9796644/,An update on polymyalgia rheumatica - PMC
"Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, which causes global burden. Antidepressants and psychotherapies are the mainstay of treatment for depression, which have limited efficacy. Thus, alternative approaches for preventing and treating depression are urgently required. Recent clinical trials and preclinical researches have clarified that peripheral facial injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is a rapid, effective and relative safe therapy for improving some symptoms of depression. Despite its safety and efficacy, the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of BoNT/A for depression remains largely unclear. In the present review, we updated and summarized the clinical and preclinical evidence supporting BoNT/A therapy for the treatment of depression. We further discussed the potential mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of BoNT/A on depression. Notably, we recently identified that the anti-depressant effects of BoNT/A associated with up-regulation of 5-HT levels and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus in a preclinical mouse model. In summary, these studies suggest that BoNT/A therapy is a potential effective and safe intervention for the management of depression. However, fundamental questions remain regarding the future prospects of BoNT/A therapy, including safety, efficacy, dose-response relationships, identification of potential predictors of response, and the precise mechanisms underlying BoNT/A therapy.",literature_review,2021,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8102733/,Botulinum Neurotoxin Therapy for Depression: Therapeutic Mechanisms and Future Perspective

Preliminary data suggest that botulinum toxin therapy may also be effective in the treatment of other mental disorders characterized by an excess of negative emotions, such as borderline personality disorder.

"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are proteins produced by bacteria of the Clostridium family. Upon oral ingestion, BoNT causes the neuroparalytic syndrome botulism. There are seven serotypes of BoNT (serotypes A-G); BoNT-A and BoNT-B are the botulinum toxin serotypes utilized for therapeutic applications. Treatment with BoNT injections is used to manage chronic medical conditions across multiple indications. As with other biologic drugs, immunogenicity after long-term treatment with BoNT formulations may occur, and repeated use can elicit antibody formation leading to clinical nonresponsiveness. Thus, approaching BoNT treatment of chronic conditions with therapeutic formulations that minimize stimulating the host immune response while balancing patient responsiveness to therapy is ideal. Immunogenicity is a clinical limitation in many settings that use biologic drugs for treatment, and clinically relevant immunogenicity reduction has been achieved through engineering smaller protein constructs and reducing unnecessary formulation components. A similar approach has influenced the evolution of BoNT formulations. Three BoNT-A products and one BoNT-B product have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for therapeutic use: onabotulinumtoxinA, abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and rimabotulinumtoxinB; a fourth BoNT-A product, daxibotulinumtoxinA, is currently under regulatory review. Additionally, prabotulinumtoxinA is a BoNT-A product that has been approved for aesthetic indications but not therapeutic use. Here, we discuss the preclinical and clinical immunogenicity data that exist within the scientific literature and provide a perspective for considering immunogenicity as a key factor in choice of BoNT formulation.",literature_review,2021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515975/,Immunogenicity of Botulinum Toxin Formulations: Potential Therapeutic Implications

"Depression is one of the leading causes of disability, and, if left unmanaged, it can increase the risk for suicide. The evidence base on the determinants of depression is fragmented, which makes the interpretation of the results across studies difficult. The objective of this study is to conduct a thorough synthesis of the literature assessing the biological, psychological, and social determinants of depression in order to piece together the puzzle of the key factors that are related to this condition. Titles and abstracts published between 2017 and 2020 were identified in PubMed, as well as Medline, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Key words relating to biological, social, and psychological determinants as well as depression were applied to the databases, and the screening and data charting of the documents took place. We included 470 documents in this literature review. The findings showed that there are a plethora of risk and protective factors (relating to biological, psychological, and social determinants) that are related to depression; these determinants are interlinked and influence depression outcomes through a web of causation.

"Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder in the world, affecting 4.4% of the global population. Despite an array of treatment modalities, depressive disorders remain difficult to manage due to many factors. Beginning with the introduction of fluoxetine to the United States in 1988, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) quickly became a mainstay of treatment for a variety of psychiatric disorders. The primary mechanism of action of SSRIs is to inhibit presynaptic reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin transporter, subsequently increasing serotonin at the postsynaptic membrane in the serotonergic synapse. The six major SSRIs that are marketed in the USA today, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine, are a group of structurally unrelated molecules that share a similar mechanism of action. While their primary mechanism of action is similar, each SSRI has unique pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and side effect profile. One of the more controversial adverse effects of SSRIs is the black box warning for increased risk of suicidality in children and young adults aged 18-24. There is a lack of understanding of the complexities and interactions between SSRIs in the developing brain of a young person with depression. Adults, who do not have certain risk factors, which could be confounding factors, do not seem to carry this increased risk of suicidality. Ultimately, when prescribing SSRIs to any patient, a risk-benefit analysis must factor in the potential treatment effects, adverse effects, and dangers of the illness to be treated. The aim of this review is to educate clinicians on potential adverse effects of SSRIs.",literature_review,2021,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8395812/,Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Adverse Effects: A Narrative Review
"Background: Botulinum toxin treatment is the most frequently performed noninvasive cosmetic procedure performed in the USA. Because of its widespread use, an analysis of the adverse event (AE) profile of Botox injections is needed. Methods: The FDA Adverse Event Report System was queried using an online web-based tool to determine the top 15 adverse events reported for four Botox brand names: Botox/Botox Cosmetic, Dysport, and Xeomin. The proportional reporting ratios (PRR) and relative odds ratios (ROR) were determined. A literature review was performed for eight AEs of clinical significance: eyelid/eyebrow ptosis, asthenia, muscular weakness, facial paresis, dysphagia, botulism, and death. Results: Botox/Botox Cosmetic had 38367 AEs. Dysport had 3582 AEs. Xeomin had 1405 AEs. All drugs with reported cases of eyelid and eyebrow ptosis had significant PRR and ROR values. The PRR and ROR values for asthenia were not significant in any of the drugs and only reached significance for Dysport for muscular weakness and dysphagia. Both Botox/Botox Cosmetic and Dysport had elevated PRRs and RORs for facial paresis and botulism. While all drugs had at least one reported case of death related to Botox injection use, none of the PRR or ROR values were significant. Conclusion: Known AEs for Botox injection use include eyelid/brow ptosis and muscular weakness. Feared but rare complications of Botox injection use include dysphagia, botulism, and possibly death, owing to systemic spread of the toxin.

"IMPORTANCE Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death. OBSERVATIONS Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria ≥300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.

Currently, no mood stabilizers are available having equal efficacy in the treatment of both mania and depression, two of which forms the extreme sides of the bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine, a well established anticonvulsant has received regulatory approval for the treatment and prevention of bipolar depression in more than 30 countries worldwide. Lamotrigine, acts through several molecular targets and overcomes the major limitation of other conventional antidepressants by stabilizing mood from ""below baseline"" thereby preventing switches to mania or episode acceleration, thus being effective for bipolar I disorder. Recent studies have also suggested that these observations could also be extended to patients with bipolar II disorder. Thus, lamotrigine may supposedly fulfill the unmet requirement for an effective depression mood stabilizer.",literature_review,2015,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4615936/,Management of bipolar depression with lamotrigine: an antiepileptic mood stabilizer
"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) cause flaccid paralysis by interfering with vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release in the neuronal cells. BoNTs are the most widely used therapeutic proteins. BoNT/A was approved by the U.S. FDA to treat strabismus, blepharospam, and hemifacial spasm as early as 1989 and then for treatment of cervical dystonia, glabellar facial lines, axillary hyperhidrosis, chronic migraine and for cosmetic use. Due to its high efficacy, longevity of action and satisfactory safety profile, it has been used empirically in a variety of ophthalmological, gastrointestinal, urological, orthopedic, dermatological, secretory, and painful disorders. Currently available BoNT therapies are limited to neuronal indications with the requirement of periodic injections resulting in immune-resistance for some indications. Recent understanding of the structure-function relationship of BoNTs prompted the engineering of novel BoNTs to extend therapeutic interventions in non-neuronal systems and to overcome the immune-resistance issue. Much research still needs to be done to improve and extend the medical uses of BoNTs.",literature_review,2012,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3496996/,"Clinical Uses of Botulinum Neurotoxins: Current Indications, Limitations and Future Developments"
"OnabotulinumtoxinA is an injectable medication that produces muscle relaxation through local chemical denervation at the neuromuscular junction. Discovery of onabotulinumtoxinA's aesthetic benefits occurred serendipitously in the 1980s at the intersection of several medical disciplines, including ophthalmology, neurology, otolaryngology, and dermatology. Patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA for blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, and dystonia noticed their periorbital wrinkles disappearing, particularly frown lines between the eyebrows called glabellar lines (GL). Aesthetic use of onabotulinumtoxinA necessitated rigorous training programs and vigilant monitoring by Allergan. Approval for the GL indication was based on 2 similarly designed, double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical studies. Subjects with moderate to severe GL receiving onabotulinumtoxinA achieved significantly greater improvement in GL severity than those receiving placebo. In subsequent studies, more than 80% of subjects were satisfied with onabotulinumtoxinA treatment through day 60, and many reported looking approximately 4 years younger at weeks 4 and 12 than at baseline. OnabotulinumtoxinA has a rapid onset of action, and peak effect occurs between 30 and 60 days. The median duration of response for dynamic GL in the initial studies was 120 days and response progressively improved with subsequent treatments. OnabotulinumtoxinA was well tolerated, and the 2 most common adverse events, headache and blepharoptosis, tended to decrease in frequency with repeat treatment.",clinical_trial_phase_3,2023,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10374180/,"Treatment of glabellar lines with Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA): Development, insights, and impact"

Fourteen female subjects with persistent MFP received BoNT-A treatment with different doses (10U-25U for temporalis muscle and 30U-75U for masseter muscle). The treatment was injected bilaterally in the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles in a single session. Clinical measurements included: self-perceived pain (VAS), pain sensibility (PPT), and muscles thickness (ultrasonography). Follow-up occurred 1, 3, 6, and 72 months after treatment for VAS and PPT and 1, 3, and 72 months for ultrasonography. For statistical analysis, the Friedman test with the Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons as a post hoc test was used for non-parametric repeated measures comparisons among the evaluation times. A 5% probability level was considered significant in all tests. VAS values presented a significant decrease throughout the study (p < 0.05). Regarding PPT values, a significant increase was found when comparing baseline data with post-treatment follow-ups (p < 0.05), and even though a significant decrease was found in muscle thickness when baseline values were compared with the 1- and 3-months assessments, no differences were found when compared with the 72 months follow-up (p > 0.05).

"Objective: To determine whether a single treatment of botulinum toxin A in the forehead (glabellar) region can improve symptoms of depression in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), as defined by DSM-IV criteria. Method: Thirty participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or botulinum toxin A (BTA; onabotulinumtoxinA) injections in the forehead. Female participants received 29 units; male participants received 39 units. At week 12, the groups were crossed over. Participants were evaluated at weeks 0, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 24 for improvement in MDD symptoms using the Patient Health Care Questionnaire-9, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and 21-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-21) objective measurement scales. The primary outcome was the rate of HDRS-21 response, defined as ≥ 50% score reduction from baseline. The study occurred from July 2011 to November 2012. Results: Patients who received BTA at week 0 (BTA-first group) and at week 12 (BTA-second group) had a statistically significant reduction in MDD symptoms as compared to placebo. Improvement in MDD continued over 24 weeks in the group that received BTA first even though the cosmetic effects of BTA wore off at 12 to 16 weeks. HDRS-21 response rates were 55% (6/11) in the BTA-first group, 24% (4/17) in the BTA-second group, and 0% (0/19) in the placebo group (P < .0001). HDRS-21 remission rates (score ≤ 7) were 18% (2/11), 18% (3/17), and 0% (0/19), respectively (P = .057). HDRS-21 scores dropped -46% and -35% in the BTA-first and -second groups versus -2% in the placebo group (P < .0001). The BDI response rate (≥ 50% reduction from baseline) was 45% (5/11) in the BTA-first group, 33% (6/18) in the BTA-second group, and 5% (1/19) in the placebo group (P = .0067). BDI remission rates (score ≤ 9) were 27% (3/11), 33% (6/18), and 5% (1/19), respectively (P = .09). BDI scores dropped -42% and -35% in the BTA-first and -second groups versus -15% in the placebo group (P < .0001).

"This study assessed the safety and efficacy of three different doses of BoNT-A for persistent myofascial pain (MFP). One hundred female subjects were randomly assigned into five groups (n = 20): oral appliance (OA), saline solution (SS) and three BoNT-A groups with different doses. Pain intensity and pressure pain threshold were evaluated up to 24 weeks after treatment. Adverse effects related to muscle contraction, masticatory performance, muscle thickness and mandibular bone volume were also assessed. Changes over time were compared within and between groups. The ""nparLD"" package and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to analyze the data. BoNT-A reduced pain intensity (p < 0.0001) and increased pressure pain threshold (p < 0.0001) for up to 24 weeks compared to the placebo. No differences were found between BoNT-A and OA at the last follow-up. A transient decline in masticatory performance (p < 0.05) and muscle contraction (p < 0.0001), and a decrease in muscle thickness (p < 0.05) and coronoid and condylar process bone volume (p < 0.05) were found as dose-related adverse effects of BoNT-A. Regardless of the dose, BoNT-A was as effective as OA on MFP. Notwithstanding, due to BoNT-A dose-related adverse effects, we suggest the use of low doses of BoNT-A in MFP patients that do not benefit from conservative treatments.",clinical_trial_phase_2,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32549196/,Efficacy and Safety of Botulinum Toxin Type A on Persistent Myofascial Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial
"Objective Botulinum toxin A has been shown to be effective in managing depression. This study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant and antianxiety effects of two different doses of botulinum toxin A in patients with mild to moderate depression. Methods A total of 140 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate depression at the Department of Neurology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from September 2020 to September 2021 were enrolled for the study. The patients were allocated into two groups and treated with two different doses of botulinum toxin A (50 units or 100 units). Depression scores (HAMD, HAMA, SDS, and SAS) were evaluated at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. Results There was a significant improvement in the depressive and anxiety symptoms following treatment with the botulinum toxin A after 12 weeks compared to the baseline. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups. Further, the factor scores of anxiety/somatization, blocking, sleep disorder, and cognitive disorder were significantly decreased after 12 weeks of treatment with 50 units of botulinum toxin A compared to the baseline (P < 0.05).

"Background: Depression is characterized by low moods, anhedonia, and social avoidance. Effective and acceptable treatments are required for depression. Positive effects on mood have been observed in patients with depression after treatment with botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A). Methods: A total of 88 patients with depression were randomly assigned to BoNT/A (n = 56) and placebo (saline, n = 22) groups. The primary objective was to determine the change in the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), 12 weeks after the treatments when compared with the baseline. Results: The BoNT/A and placebo groups did not differ significantly in all the collected baseline characteristics. However, there was a significant improvement in the depressive symptoms of the BoNT/A group compared to those of the placebo group throughout the 12-week follow-up period. This was according to the measurements of HAMD (F (1, 370) = 9.094, P = 0.0027), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) (F (1, 370) = 11.26, P < 0.001), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) (F (1, 410) = 8.673, P = 0.0034) and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) (F (1, 379) = 5.788, P = 0.017). Furthermore, the effectiveness was even higher at the end of the study period. Limitations: The limitations include the absence of a multicenter study and an inadequate number of cases.

The PICOS strategy was used for the selection of studies and risk-of-bias assessment was performed using Cochrane's tool for RCTs. RCTs were included if they compared BT-A treatment on facial muscles in patients with mood disorders to placebo. After assessment of the full texts, seven studies were selected. Five studies had low risk of bias for the generation of random sequence and blinding of participants and professional domains. A total of four studies showed a low risk of bias for the allocation concealment and blinding of the evaluation of the domain results. The domain of selective reports showed a low risk of bias in all included studies. However, four studies presented a high risk of bias for the domain of other biases. The meta-analysis was based on the mean difference or standardized mean difference between the BT-A and placebo groups for each selected trial and revealed that the BT-A group showed a significant improvement in the symptoms of depression when compared to placebo.

Aims: Evaluation of subject-reported indicators of treatment efficacy, satisfaction, and psychological well-being with ABO dose escalation. Methods: A Phase 2, 36-week, multicenter, randomized, dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in adults with moderate to severe glabellar lines. Subjects received a single ABO treatment, dosed at 50, 75, 100, or 125 U, or placebo. Efficacy endpoints comprised subject-assessed improvement in line severity of ≥1-grade from baseline at maximum frown, global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS) grade, FACE-Q appraisal of lines, psychological well-being and age, and subject satisfaction. Results: The study included 399 subjects (88.2% were female). Respective responder rates (≥1-grade improvement) with ABO 50-125 U doses ranged between 96.3%-100% at Week 4, 65.0%-67.9% at Week 24, and 33.8%-44.4% at Week 36. GAIS responder rate and FACE-Q appraisal of lines showed a similar pattern of change. Satisfaction was high and psychological well-being was improved from Week 4 through Week 36, with natural, youthful, and refreshed appearance reported for all ABO doses. Conclusions: A single ABO treatment (dosed at 50-125 U) provided significant and sustained improvements in glabellar line severity over durations up to 36 weeks, versus placebo.

"Objectives: Effective strategy for the treatment of depression is limited. This study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) in the treatment of depression. Methods: Seventy-six patients were assigned to the BoNT/A group (n = 52) and sertraline control group (n = 24). For the BoNT/A group, BoNT/A was injected into the frowning muscle, depressor muscle, occipital frontalis muscle, lateral canthus, and bilateral temporal region at 20 sites. Five units per site and a total of 100 units of BoNT/A were given. Patients in the sertraline control group were medicated with sertraline 50-200 mg (114.58 ± 52.08 mg) per day. Depression was assessed by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17), 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA-14), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). All participants were followed up for 12 weeks. Results: Scores of HAMD, HAMA, SDS, and SAS decreased significantly in both BoNT/A and sertraline groups after treatment for 12 weeks. Overall, there were no differences in decreased magnitude between the two groups (p > .05). The HAMA, SDS, and SAS results showed that the onset time of BoNT/A was earlier than that of sertraline. Side effects rates were 15.38% for BoNT/A and 33.33% for sertraline. Conclusion: This study demonstrated significant antidepressant effects of BoNT/A. The efficacy of BoNT/A was comparable with established antidepressant sertraline. The onset time of BoNT/A was earlier than sertraline, and the proportion of side effects was less than sertraline.

Subjects were rated at screening, and 3 and 6 weeks after OBA treatment. The primary outcome measure was the response rate, as defined by ≥ 50% decrease in score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Response rates at 6 weeks from the date of injection were 52% and 15% in the OBA and placebo groups, respectively (Chi-Square (1) = 11.2, p < 0.001, Fisher p < 0.001).

"Depression is one of the common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the clinic, botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) has been used to treat depression. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the anti-depressive effect of BoNT/A in a PD mouse model. Mice were administered reserpine (3 μg/mL in the drinking water) for 10 weeks. From the 10th week, BoNT/A (10 U·kg-1·d-1) was injected into the cheek for 3 consecutive days. We showed that chronic administration of reserpine produced the behavioral phenotypes of depression and neurochemical changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. BoNT/A treatment significantly ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors, but did not improve TH activity in SNpc of reserpine-treated mice. We demonstrated that BoNT/A treatment reversed reserpine-induced complement and microglia activation in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, BoNT/A treatment significantly attenuated the microglial engulfment of presynaptic synapses, thus ameliorating the apparent synapse and spine loss in the hippocampus in the reserpine-treated mice. Moreover, BoNT/A treatment suppressed microglia-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in reserpine-treated mice. In addition, we showed that BoNT/A (0.1 U/mL) ameliorated reserpine-induced complement and microglia activation in mouse BV2 microglial cells in vitro. We conclude that BoNT/A ameliorates depressive-like behavior in a reserpine-induced PD mouse model through reversing the synapse loss mediated by classical complement induced-microglial engulfment as well as alleviating microglia-mediated proinflammatory responses.",preclinical_animal_model,2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36765267/,Botulinum neurotoxin A ameliorates depressive-like behavior in a reserpine-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model via suppressing hippocampal microglial engulfment and neuroinflammation
"The present study was designed to examine the therapeutic effects of Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) on depression-like behaviors in mice and to explore the potential mechanisms. These results revealed that a single facial injection of BoNT/A induced a rapid and prolonged improvement of depression-like behaviors in naïve and space-restriction-stressed (SRS) mice, reflected by a decreased duration of immobility in behavioral despair tests. BoNT/A significantly increased the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in several brain regions, including the hippocampus and hypothalamus, in SRS mice. BoNT/A increased the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B in the hippocampus, which were significantly decreased in SRS mice. Furthermore, BoNT/A significantly increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, which were decreased in SRS mice. Finally, BoNT/A transiently increased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB), which were suppressed in the hippocampus of SRS mice. Collectively, these results demonstrated that BoNT/A treatment has anti-depressant-like activity in mice, and this is associated with increased 5-HT levels and the activation of BDNF/ERK/CREB pathways in the hippocampus, supporting further investigation of BoNT/A therapy in depression.",preclinical_animal_model,2019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30900142/,Antidepressant-Like Action of Single Facial Injection of Botulinum Neurotoxin A is Associated with Augmented 5-HT Levels and BDNF/ERK/CREB Pathways in Mouse Brain

Development of cell-based potency assays (CBPAs) to assess the biological function of BoNT/A have been challenging because of its potency. CBPAs can evaluate the key steps of BoNT action: receptor binding, internalization-translocation, and catalytic activity; and therefore could replace the current mouse bioassay. Primary neurons possess appropriate sensitivity to develop potential replacement assays but those potency assays are difficult to perform and validate. This report describes a CBPA utilizing differentiated human neuroblastoma SiMa cells and a sandwich ELISA that measures BoNT/A-dependent intracellular increase of cleaved SNAP25. Assay sensitivity is similar to the mouse bioassay and measures neurotoxin biological activity in bulk drug substance and BOTOX® product (onabotulinumtoxinA). Validation of a version of this CBPA in a Quality Control laboratory has led to FDA, Health Canada, and European Union approval for potency testing of BOTOX®, BOTOX® Cosmetic, and Vistabel®. Moreover, we also developed and optimized a BoNT/A CBPA screening assay that can be used for the discovery of novel BoNT/A inhibitors to treat human disease.",other,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23185348/,Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A specific cell-based potency assay to replace the mouse bioassay
"Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is a metalloprotease that blocks synaptic transmission via the cleavage of SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa). BoNT/A is successfully used in clinical neurology for the treatment of several neuromuscular pathologies and pain syndromes. Despite its widespread use, relatively little is known on BoNT/A intracellular trafficking in neurons. Using the visual pathway as a model system, here we show that catalytically active BoNT/A is capable of undergoing anterograde axonal transport and transcytosis. Following BoNT/A injection into the rat eye, significant levels of BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP-25 appeared in the retinorecipient layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Anterograde propagation of BoNT/A effects required axonal transport, ruling out a systemic spread of the toxin. Cleaved SNAP-25 was present in presynaptic structures of the tectum, but retinal terminals were devoid of the immunoreactivity, indicative of transcytosis. Experiments based on sequential administration of BoNT/A and BoNT/E showed a persistent catalytic activity of BoNT/A in tectal cells following its injection into the retina. Our findings demonstrate that catalytically active BoNT/A is anterogradely transported from the eye to the SC and transcytosed to tectal synapses. These data are important for a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of action of BoNT/A.",other,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22049408/,Evidence for anterograde transport and transcytosis of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A)
"Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) is one of the most lethal toxins known. Its extreme toxicity is due to its light chain (LC), a zinc protease that cleaves SNAP-25, a synaptosome-associated protein, leading to the inhibition of neuronal activity. Studies on BoNT/A LC have revealed that two regions, termed exosites, can play an important role in BoNT catalytic activity. A clear understanding of how these exosites influence neurotoxin catalytic activity would provide a critical framework for deciphering the mechanism of SNAP-25 cleavage and the design of inhibitors. Herein, based on the crystallographic structure of BoNT/A LC complexed with its substrate, we designed an α-exosite binding probe. Experiments with this unique probe demonstrated that α-exosite binding enhanced both catalytic activity and stability of the LC. These data help delineate why α-exosite binding is needed for SNAP-25 cleavage and also provide new insights into the extended lifetime observed for BoNT/A LC in vivo.",other,2014,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4222541/,Probing BoNT/A Protease Exosites: Implications for Inhibitor Design and Light Chain Longevity
