The <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes are integral members of the HR pathway, are required for functional HR and when disrupted are associated with predisposition to a variety of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Venkitaraman, 2002</xref>). <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations and other HR defects, have potential therapeutic relevance when used to support agents that introduce or exploit double-stranded DNA breaks. For example, better outcomes have been observed in patients with <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations following treatment with DNA-damaging agents such as platinum salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hennessy <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), or targeted agents such as PARP inhibitors (PARPi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bryant <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Cells deficient for <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> are highly sensitive to <italic>PARP1</italic> inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bryant <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), which are currently in use in clinical trials for cancer patients with <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> germline mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gelmon <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">O&#x02019;Shaughnessy <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that HR deficiency in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is not solely due to germline <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hennessy <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">The Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA), 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byler Dann <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2011)</xref> reported a defect in at least one HR pathway gene in approximately half of the &#x0223c;500 EOC in the data set.</p><p>Although <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> are thought of primarily as breast and EOC susceptibility genes, mutations in these genes have been reported in a number of other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Friedenson, 2005</xref>). Epigenetic silencing of <italic>BRCA1</italic> has also been reported in non-small-cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Marsit <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Narayan <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), and EOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wilcox <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Several other HR genes have also been reported to be mutated in other human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerbinskaite <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). In addition to the complexity of types of alterations resulting in HR deficiency, each cancer type would appear to have a unique spectrum of HR defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerbinskaite <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Defects in the HR pathway might result in specific structural changes in DNA. Previously, chromosomal copy number (CN) changes have been reported to be associated with <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stefansson <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Holstege <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). This study examines the association between genomic patterns of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and HR deficiency. Loss of heterozygosity was examined in preference to CN because LOH results in the irreversible loss of one of the parental alleles. In contrast, CN gains are not necessarily permanent. Therefore, we hypothesised that, if HR deficiency leaves a footprint of genomic alterations, LOH may provide a more stable record of those changes compared with CN variants. In this study we analysed patterns of genome-wide LOH in three different EOC data sets extensively characterised for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> defects. An LOH-based score was developed, which is strongly associated with functional defects in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>. This score also strongly correlates with promoter methylation of <italic>RAD51C</italic>, a gene implicated in the HR pathway.</p><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Additional information can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>.</p><sec><title>Ovarian tumour samples</title><p>Three independent human EOC cohorts were used. 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;152 unselected EOC samples from the Gynaecology Cancer Banks at MD Anderson Cancer Centre (MDACC) and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF).

Methylation and expression analysis of <italic>BRCA2</italic> did not identify any samples harbouring these defects. Thirty-one of 152 samples from the first cohort were carriers of mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and/or <italic>BRCA2</italic>, along with 14/53 from the second cohort and 83/435 from the third cohort (two of which were excluded from further analysis, see below). Mutations are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>.</p><p>The degree of methylation was measured for promoter CpG islands of both <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>. Methylation in multiple samples was observed for <italic>BRCA1</italic>, but not <italic>BRCA2</italic>. Eleven of 126 samples from the first cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), 3 of 34 from the second cohort and 64 of 435 from the third cohort were defined as HR deficient due to high levels of <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter methylation. With the exception of one sample from the third cohort, none of the samples with a methylated <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter had concordant <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations.</p><p>Mechanisms other than promoter methylation could result in low mRNA expression of <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> that might also lead to HR deficiency. <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> expression levels were measured for 137 samples from the first cohort and 53 samples from the second cohort. Expression of <italic>BRCA1</italic> in 20 samples was abnormally low. Only five samples with abnormally low expression of <italic>BRCA1</italic> were not flagged as HR deficient because of <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). No abnormally low expression was observed for <italic>BRCA2</italic>.</p><p>In this analysis, samples were only classified as BRCA deficient if <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> was contained within a region of LOH and carried a mutation, was methylated, or was expressed at low levels. Two <italic>BRCA2-</italic>mutant samples that did not have LOH were not considered HR deficient in our analysis. In total, in the three data sets analysed (<italic>n</italic>=640) there were 211 samples with <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations, methylation, or low expression. In all but two of these cases, both with <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations, there was homozygosity at the affected gene due to LOH.</p></sec><sec><title>Distribution of lengths of LOH regions</title><p>SNP analysis was used to determine the distribution of lengths of LOH regions throughout the genome. The lengths of LOH regions adjusted to the length of chromosome arm on which the LOH regions were observed are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Three distinct features were observed in this distribution. First, there are many short LOH regions (&#x0003c;15&#x02009;Mb). Second, there is a long flat tail of LOH regions up to the length of a single chromosome arm with few LOH regions covering more than one chromosome arm but less than the whole chromosome. Finally, there is a high peak corresponding to LOH over the whole chromosome.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation between samples with HR deficiency and LOH</title><p>At high levels of contamination of a tumour sample with normal tissue the assays used in the study might be unreliable. Although LOH reconstruction from SNP microarray data appear to be robust up to 85% contamination and mutation detection results up to 90% contamination, methylation and RNA expression assays are more sensitive to contamination and become unreliable above 65% of contamination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Results</xref>). Therefore, samples with contamination above 65% have been excluded from the analysis: 20 samples from the first cohort (two of them with <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations), 10 samples from the second cohort (one of them with a <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation), and one sample from the third cohort.</p><p>The first cohort of samples was used as the &#x02018;discovery&#x02019; cohort. LOH regions on chromosome 17 were excluded from the analysis, because LOH was observed over this chromosome in almost all samples. We checked for correlation between HR deficiency and the number of short LOH regions (&#x0003c;15&#x02009;Mb), the number of long LOH regions (&#x0003e;15&#x02009;Mb but less than the whole chromosome), and the number of LOH regions covering whole chromosomes. The value of 15&#x02009;Mb was selected somewhat arbitrarily, but further analysis showed that the exact value of this cut-off does not have significant impact on the results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). There was no significant correlation between the number of short LOH regions and HR deficiency. The number of LOH regions covering the whole chromosome was significantly greater in tumours with intact <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> (<italic>P</italic>=4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>). The number of long LOH regions (&#x0003e;15&#x02009;Mb but less than the whole chromosome) was significantly higher in tumours with deficient <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> (<italic>P</italic>=10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Homologous recombination deficiency was not correlated with the number of LOH regions covering whole chromosomes in the second cohort, possibly due to low sample number, but this observation was confirmed in the third cohort (<italic>P</italic>=3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref>).

In the TCGA data set there were no <italic>RAD51C</italic> or <italic>RAD51D</italic> mutations reported; however, 11/435 samples had methylation of the <italic>RAD51C</italic> promoter.

Copy number analysis revealed 2/132 samples from the first data set (HRD scores=11 and 21) and 0/43 samples from the second data set had homozygous deletions of <italic>PTEN</italic>. Both of the <italic>PTEN</italic>-deficient samples also had defects in either <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic>. In the third data set 11/435 samples had homozygous deletions of <italic>PTEN</italic>, and their HRD scores ranged from 9&#x02013;22. An additional 3/435 samples had likely deleterious mutations (nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations) in <italic>PTEN</italic> with homozygosity at the <italic>PTEN</italic> locus because of LOH (HRD scores=8, 16, 24). Five of these samples had defects in <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, or <italic>RAD51C</italic>. The remaining nine samples had a significantly elevated (<italic>P</italic>=0.004) average HRD score of 14.5 (range 8&#x02013;24) consistent with <italic>PTEN</italic> having a role in homologous recombination.</p><p>In the third cohort presumed deleterious mutations and methylation of HR pathway genes have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">TCGA, 2011</xref>). The mutations were examined and the analysis was limited to defects with a high likelihood of being deleterious (for example, nonsense and frameshift mutations), resulting in a total of eight deleterious mutations in six genes (<italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>ATR</italic>, <italic>FANCA</italic>, <italic>FANCD2</italic>, <italic>FANCM</italic>, and <italic>PALB2</italic>) not discussed above. An additional five samples had methylation of HR pathway genes. Loss of heterozygosity was detected in only 1 of the 13 samples (a <italic>FANCM</italic> nonsense mutation). As deactivation of both alleles is needed to lose function of a tumour suppressor, 12 of these 13 samples are expected to have intact HR. Not surprisingly, the HRD score was not elevated in the majority of these samples (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of combined data</title><p>Correlation between the HRD score and HR deficiency (defined as deficiency of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, or <italic>RAD51C</italic>) for all three cohorts is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.

To answer this, the distributions of HRD scores for <italic>BRCA1-</italic>, <italic>BRCA2-</italic>, and <italic>RAD51C-</italic>deficient tumours were analysed separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).

The differences in HRD scores between either <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>RAD51C</italic> (14.5; s.d.=5.1) were not significant.</p><p>To determine whether mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> were germline or somatic, normal tissue was analysed when available. A subset of normal samples from the first and second cohorts, and all samples from the third cohort were available. There was no significant difference in the distributions of HRD scores for either <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> deficiency between germline and somatic mutations, or between mutations and either methylation or low expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Homologous recombination deficiency score in <italic>BRCA1-</italic> and <italic>BRCA2-</italic>deficient cell lines</title><p>Unselected breast (<italic>n</italic>=32) and ovarian (<italic>n</italic>=21) cell lines were obtained from multiple sources and screened for mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic>. In addition three colon and one pancreatic cell line from NCI60 were analysed. Of these 57 cell lines, six either carried homozygous deleterious mutations or had methylation of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter and LOH at <italic>BRCA1</italic>, one had a homozygous mutation with an apparent functional reversion, and six carried heterozygous mutations (mutations are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the distributions of HRD scores for these three groups of mutants, as well as for samples that do not carry BRCA mutations. The distributions of HRD scores among ovarian tumours and cancer cell lines without BRCA defects were not significantly different. The distribution of HRD scores among cancer cell lines with heterozygous mutations is similar to cancer cell lines without BRCA defects, presumably because cells become HR deficient only when both copies of <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> are non-functional. For cancer cell lines with functional loss of both copies of either <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2,</italic> higher HRD scores are observed, similar to HRD scores observed for ovarian tumours with <italic>BRCA1-, BRCA2-,</italic> or <italic>RAD51C-</italic>deficient genes. The HRD score is also high for the cancer cell line with reversion of a <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation. The difference of the distribution of HRD scores in either wild-type or heterozygous mutant cell lines, and the distribution of HRD scores in cell lines with either homozygous mutations (with or without reversion) or methylation of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter is highly significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001). Importantly, there is significant correlation between HRD score and <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> deficiency even after excluding EOC cell lines from the data set (<italic>P</italic>=0.01), suggesting that association of HRD score with HR deficiency is not restricted to EOC.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation between HR deficiency and overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)</title><p>Correlation was not detected between HRD score and either OS or PFS for the first two cohorts, possibly because of cohort size. Significant correlation was observed between PFS (<italic>P</italic>=0.03) and OS (<italic>P</italic>=6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) for the third cohort with improved survival for patients with higher HRD scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study reports the development of a DNA-based HRD score based on genome-wide LOH analysis of ovarian tumours combined with comprehensive profiling of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> defects. The HRD score is strongly associated with the integrity of homologous recombination, as measured by <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, and <italic>RAD51C</italic> defects. The correlation of HRD score and HR deficiency was validated in two independent EOC data sets, as well as breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines.</p><p>The initial hypothesis was that regions of LOH of different length might appear in the cancer genome through different pathways, thus tumours with HR deficiency might manifest a specific pattern of LOH. In this study, we identified an intermediate class of LOH sizes &#x0003e;15&#x02009;Mb but less than a whole chromosome that was highly positively correlated with defective HR genes suggesting that most if not all, of this type of LOH class exists, because it incorporates double-stranded DNA breaks as part of its genesis and requires repair by HR. In contrast, LOH at the whole chromosome level is significantly less frequent in HR-deficient tumours. One possible explanation is that LOH at the whole chromosome level frequently originates through an alternative mechanism that does not involve double-stranded DNA breaks.</p><p>In addition to <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> defects, <italic>RAD51C</italic> promoter methylation was observed in ovarian tumours. High HRD score was significantly associated with <italic>RAD51C</italic> deficiency in two data sets. Elevated HRD scores were also seen in <italic>PTEN</italic>-deficient tumours, consistent with reports that <italic>PTEN-</italic>defective tumour cell are HR defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mendes-Pereira <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Only one additional HR gene mutation was confirmed in the three data sets, a nonsense mutation in <italic>FANCM</italic> with LOH resulting in loss of the second allele. The HRD score associated with the <italic>FANCM</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">TCGA, 2011</xref>) is within the range of the normal distribution for samples with elevated HRD score.</p><p>Among tumours with apparently intact <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, and <italic>RAD51C,</italic> a substantial fraction of the samples have an elevated HRD score. Two possible explanations are that there is a substantial rate of defects in other genes in the HR pathway in many of these samples, or that the HRD score is non-specific.</p><p>Published studies have demonstrated that secondary reversion mutations that restore <italic>BRCA2</italic> function can arise in <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutant cell lines after exposure to platinum agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Norquist <italic>et al</italic> (2011)</xref> observed similar findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, with &#x0223c;28% of recurrent tumours having a secondary mutation that restored <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> function. Reversion mutations were observed primarily in individuals with prior exposure to platinum agents and were predictive of resistance to platinum. As the HRD score results from cumulative defects occurring in the genome of the tumour, it should not be sensitive to reversion mutations. Post-treatment samples were not available from the tumours used in this study, however, the limited data obtained from cell lines with reversion mutations is consistent with this hypothesis. It should be noted that the insensitivity of the HRD score to reversion mutations would affect few tumours in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Norquist <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birkbak <italic>et al</italic> (2012)</xref> have reported a telomeric allelic imbalance score, which predicted pathological complete response to cisplatin treatment in triple negative breast cancer patients. Although the score itself is very different from the score we have identified, which is based solely on LOH, future plans include investigating how well correlated the HRD and TAI scores are with one another. In addition, we would like to determine whether the TAI score is associated with <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, and <italic>RAD51C</italic> defects in our cohorts similar to the HRD score.</p><p>Current studies are focused on evaluating the ability of the HRD score to identify BRCA-deficient tumours in breast and pancreatic cancer data sets. If the HRD score is validated as a surrogate marker for HR deficiency, regardless of mechanism, it could be used as a quick and reliable assay for tumour stratification. In addition, studies are underway to investigate the ability of this score to predict response to both platinum agents and PARPi. The current data suggest that a high HRD score is highly correlated with HR deficiency, and that this score could be utilised to identify patients with high likelihood of responding to DNA damaging agents and PARPi. Such a test would have clinical utility in breast and EOC, and could conceivably be used to expand the use of PARPi and platinum salts to other cancers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>STR DNA fingerprinting was done by the Cancer Centre Support Grant-funded Characterised Cell Line core at MD Anderson Cancer Centre, NCI no.
