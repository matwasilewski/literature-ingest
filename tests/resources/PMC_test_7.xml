In this study, we examined the effect of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG on transcription in human cells and investigated the subsequent effects on protein function following translation of the resulting mRNA. In HEK293 cells, <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG induced incorporation of uridine or cytidine in nascent RNA opposite the adduct. In cells containing active <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), which repairs <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG, 3% misincorporation of uridine was observed opposite the lesion. In cells where AGT function was compromised by addition of the AGT inhibitor <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine, &#x0223c;58% of the transcripts contained a uridine misincorporation opposite the lesion. Furthermore, the altered mRNA induced changes to protein function as demonstrated through recovery of functional red fluorescent protein (RFP) from DNA coding for a non-fluorescent variant of RFP. These data show that <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG is highly mutagenic at the level of transcription in human cells, leading to an altered protein load, especially when AGT is inhibited.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Radiation and chemicals can give rise to reactive species that damage DNA, producing strand breaks, abasic sites, and altered bases, sugars and phosphate groups. These structural modifications to the genetic material often exert detrimental effects on replication and gene expression, compromising DNA&#x02019;s role as the repository of cellular information. DNA-dependent DNA polymerases can stall at damaged sites in the template, giving rise to collapsed replication forks, or synthesize incorrect products as they progress past the lesions, causing mutations in the daughter DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). DNA-dependent RNA polymerases can also stall at damaged bases in DNA or bypass the lesions, resulting in altered transcripts in a process called transcriptional mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>). To avert the deleterious effects of DNA damage, cells have evolved an elaborate array of DNA repair pathways that maintain and preserve DNA structure. But when genomic maintenance is compromised due to aberrant DNA repair, the accumulated damage and associated effects on replication and transcription result in pathology that can include cancer and developmental deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Among the chemical agents that damage DNA are those that alkylate the purines, pyrimidines and phosphate groups. Methylating agents, such as the chemical <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (MNU) or the endogenous metabolite <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine, produce two abundant lesions, 7-methylguanine, which is relatively innocuous, and 3-methyladenine, which is cytotoxic. Methylating agents that tend to be highly carcinogenic, which include MNU, also form significant amounts of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-methylguanine (<italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-position of guanine is a target site for alkylation by certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 1,3-<italic>bis</italic> (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and temozolomide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). BCNU adds a chloroethyl group to the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-position of guanine, which subsequently rearranges and forms a cytotoxic interstrand DNA crosslink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Temozolomide spontaneously degrades, giving rise to a methyldiazonium ion that methylates DNA, including the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-position of guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In both cases, the formation of the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkylated guanine plays an important role in the cytotoxic mechanism of these drugs.</p><p><italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-MeG is highly mutagenic, instructing DNA polymerases to incorporate thymine instead of cytosine opposite the lesion, resulting in GC to AT transitions during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-MeG is also cytotoxic because it invokes DNA mismatch repair that results in a cycle of futile attempts at clearing the lesion, ultimately producing DNA strand breaks and inducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The mutagenic and cytotoxic consequences of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG are ameliorated by the presence of the protein <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkylguanine&#x02013;DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>). AGT is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and works in a similar way in each. The protein binds to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG, removes the methyl group and transfers it to a cysteine located within the AGT active site, generating <italic>S</italic>-methylcysteine in the protein and restoring guanine in DNA. AGT&#x02019;s action is not enzymatic: Its activity cannot be regenerated after it has repaired a single lesion. AGT can also remove longer chain alkyl groups from the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-position of guanine; hence, it should come as no surprise that AGT interferes with the chemotherapeutic efficacy of agents that alkylate the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-position of guanine. In the case of BCNU, AGT repairs the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-chloroethylguanine intermediate, thwarting the formation of the cytotoxic DNA interstrand crosslink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). For temozolomide, AGT repairs <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG, thus clearing a cytotoxic DNA lesion that induces apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In biochemical studies, <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG induces transcriptional mutagenesis when RNA polymerases bypass the lesion, resulting in significant incorporation of uridine into nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, the impact of this observation has not been demonstrated in human cells, either at the level of altered transcripts or on the ensuing effects on protein function. To examine this, a strategy was used in which a site-specific <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG was positioned on the transcribed strand of a gene encoding a fluorescence-defective red fluorescent protein (RFP) variant in a plasmid that does not contain any known mammalian origin of replication. Transcription past the lesion that resulted in cytidine incorporation produced mRNA that encoded proteins with no fluorescent activity. In contrast, incorporation of uridine resulted in transcripts that encoded the sequence of a functional, fluorescent protein providing a clear demonstration that transcriptional mutagenesis can produce altered RNA that affects protein function following translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals and biochemicals</title><p>PspOMI, DpnI, BfuAI, NotI, SalI, T4 PNK, T4 DNA ligase and helper phage M13K07 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Waltham, MA, USA).

These findings are in agreement with biochemical data demonstrating that this adduct induces base misincorporation events during transcription by human RNA polymerase II, resulting in significant insertion of uridine opposite the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Furthermore, the production of altered mRNA following transcription past <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG is consistent with the recovery of RFP activity in HEK293 cells, showing that mutant transcripts do indeed change the primary amino acid sequence of proteins and that such change is reflected as altered protein function in cells.</p><p>DNA repair affects the magnitude of base changes to RNA that are induced during transcriptional mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44 B45 B46">42&#x02013;46</xref>). In the presence of functional AGT, &#x0223c;3% of the transcripts were mutated following HEK293 transfection with a plasmid containing <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG, and only an occasional RFP-positive cell was observed. In contrast, inhibition of AGT by the drug <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine resulted in virtually all cells exhibiting RFP fluorescence, with two-thirds of the transcripts containing a mutation. Hence, inhibiting repair of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG led to increased transcriptional mutagenesis. Thus, the consequences of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG formation in cellular DNA are not limited to S phase, when it can induce mutations during replication, but are also observed during transcription. Hence, AGT may well protect all cells from the harmful effects of alkylation at the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-position of guanine, including those that are terminally differentiated and not replicating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>For human RNA polymerase II, the extent of uridine misincorporation during transcription past <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in cells differs from results using nuclear extracts as the source of the transcription machinery. When HeLa nuclear extract was the source of RNA polymerase II, misincorporation of uridine opposite <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG occurred 25% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This is in contrast to the 58% uridine misincorporation reported here for transcription past the lesion in cells when AGT was inhibited with <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription experiments with the local sequence used in this study revealed a misincorporation ratio similar to the results obtained in cells suggesting possible sequence context effects rather than differences between the two assays (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq706/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). A comparison between <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG-induced transcriptional mutagenesis and replicative mutagenesis reveals some distinct similarities. Replicative DNA polymerases incorporate thymidine or cytidine opposite <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG, with reported T&#x02009;:&#x02009;C ratios ranging from 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 to 7&#x02009;:&#x02009;1, depending on the precise polymerase and DNA sequence studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Other replication products have been observed but to a much lesser extent, including incorporation of adenine and small deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). For DNA polymerases, these data are consistent with the GC &#x02192; AT transition mutations that have been reported in a variety of assays used to examine replication past <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in cells. The mutational events reported for DNA polymerases correspond to those observed for human RNA polymerase II, suggesting that the underlying mechanism governing base misincorporation opposite <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG during transcription and replication are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).</p><p>DNA repair modulates the consequences of DNA damage during replication, often suppressing mutagenesis by removing the DNA lesions prior to S phase. Hence, in the absence of AGT, the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG mutation frequency escalates during replication, reaching 75&#x02013;90% in human 293 cells and 90&#x02013;99% in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48 B49 B50">48&#x02013;50</xref>). This is in marked contrast to the much lower mutation frequencies of 5&#x02013;25% observed when AGT is active. Interestingly, the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG-induced mutation frequency in cells is virtually independent of DNA sequence, which is in contrast to biochemical data. For example, primer extension studies with <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA polymerase showed differences in mutation frequency depending on sequence context, but this result was not reproduced in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>Methylation damage to DNA poses a threat to cell viability. Exogenous and endogenous methylating agents are ubiquitous and contribute to the production of methylation damage in DNA, including the formation of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG. It is estimated that <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine alone may react with DNA in a typical mammalian cell to produce 10&#x02013;30 <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG adducts per cell per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Actual measurements of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in DNA from human tissues suggest that the lesion persists with steady-state values that, while widely variable, amount to 1.4&#x02013;220 lesions per 10<sup>9</sup>&#x02009;nt, with lower values measured in blood and the higher levels found in lung tissue from smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). While the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG levels are low relative to the total number of bases found in DNA, there is the possibility that the lesion could be present within a transcription unit in a few cells per day, contributing to transcriptional mutagenesis. The majority of such mutations to RNA may well be transient and perhaps even benign due to RNA turnover; however, based on the evidence presented here and elsewhere, it is possible that transcriptional mutagenesis, rather than replication-induced mutations, may be among the principal inducers of many human diseases, ranging from cancer to prion activation, though there is no direct evidence that this is the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p><p>The drug <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine, which was used to inhibit AGT activity in this study, has been used as a co-chemotherapeutic agent in clinical trials to treat tumors of the central nervous system. By inhibiting AGT, <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine sensitizes cells to alkylating agents such as BCNU that form adducts at the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-position of guanine. Inhibiting AGT prevents the repair of the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkyl lesion, potentially making the alkyating agent more effective as an anti-tumorigenic compound. But the data presented here show that inhibiting the action of AGT induces transcriptional mutagenesis. In fact, the maximum concentration of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine measured in patient blood has been reported as 8&#x02013;11&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, which is consistent with the concentration used in the growth medium in experiments reported here, suggesting that the drug could induce transcriptional mutations in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p><p>The studies described here used an RFP reporter that permitted the analysis of transcriptional mutagenesis in individual cells, both at the level of the RNA and the subsequent effects on protein function. While RFP alterations do not affect cell physiology, the reporter-based system does allow visualization of transcriptional mutagenesis in single cells, providing insight into the distribution in mutation frequencies across the population of cells rather than just observing averages. This information will be important in considering what is happening in a population of cells where the damaged gene cannot be visualized directly. The work of Saxowsky <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) has been able to show that mutations at the level of transcription can affect cellular processes. They examined the effect of 8-oxoguanine in inducing mutations in Ras protein at the level of transcriptional mutagenesis. They discovered that a population of constitutively active Ras proteins was produced via transcriptional mutagenesis, which led to downstream events in the Ras pathway. Furthermore, these same events were induced by mutations to the <italic>ras</italic> gene, showing that transcriptional mutations, while transient in nature, can significantly affect cells, possibly leading to oncogene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The work reported here concerning <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG indicates that this lesion can also induce transcriptional mutagenesis, and its effect could be serious since it exhibits a high mutation frequency in the absence of repair. An active gene containing <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-meG in a position sensitive to a T to C transition could transiently produce as much as 66% altered transcripts from that copy of the gene, resulting in a reduction of wt protein. This would be detrimental during development and could affect overall cell viability.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the <funding-source>National Institute of Environmental Health Science</funding-source> or the <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source>.
